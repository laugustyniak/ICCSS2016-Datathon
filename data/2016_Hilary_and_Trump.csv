[unknown student speaker]: I'll be graduating in May, and on graduation I'll be heading to Annapolis, the naval academy, to major in systems engineering.
Clinton: All right, good luck.
Ellen Charmin, Student: My name is Ellen Charmin (ph). I'm a junior at Monticello High School. I started taking Kirkwood classes my sophomore year. I began taking an online class. I'm currently in the arts and sciences academy. And by the time that I graduate, I'll have 48 credit hours done.
Clinton: Really?
Charmin: Yeah.
Clinton:Year and a half. Wow. That's great!
Charmin: Yep.
Clinton: OK.
Diane Temple, Student: I'm Diane Temple. I'm an away girl at heart. For the last 21 years I've been a high school as an English teacher. I spent six years here part time as an adjunct composition instructor.
Clinton: Great.
Mason McLaughlin, Student: I'm Jason McLaughlin. I'm a 7th through 12th grade principal at Central City High School. We're one of the eight partner schools that partner with the facility to send kids of all grades for opportunities. We're happy to have you here. Welcome to Monticello.
Clinton: Thanks. Thank you.
I'll introduce...[crosstalk]
Clinton: That's good. That's a good luck omen. [laughter]
McLaughlin: Yeah.
Drew Mullin, Student: I'm Drew Mullin. I'm a junior at central city. I'm currently taking auto tech and biotech programs here. I've had a great time. It gives a taste of the college experience. I plan to go on and do something with engineering after I get out of high school.
Clinton: Great. Good. Thanks.
Bethany Moore, Student: I'm Bethany Moore. I'm what they call a non-traditional college student. I'm taking business administration management, and I also am doing the continuing ed program here at Kirkwood.
Clinton: Great.
Well, first I want thank you, Nick, for having me here and a few of my friends in the college. I just had a terrific tour of the advanced manufacturing laboratory. I got to talk with the instructor and four of the students, all of whom are high school students who are doing what you have described as the great opportunity to mix your high school years with college learning and college credits as you move forward.
And I am really pleased to be at a community college that is visionary and effective and trying to serve as a bridge for people who are non-traditional but coming back to add to their stills all the Beltway high school students who are taking advantage of the opportunities. And the cooperation between the college and the high school is something I want to see a lot more. This is a real model for how we can provide more continuous learning starting in high school but going as far as necessary to help better prepare not only young people but all people for the economy that is awaiting us.
And before we get started — because I want to hear from each of you, I want more information about what you see as challenges as students and educators and the opportunities you hope to take advantage of — I just want to tell you a little bit about why I'm here today. I think we all know that Americans have come back from some tough economic times. And our economy and our country are much better off because American families have basically done whatever it took to make it work. But I think it's fair to say that as you look across the country, the deck is still stacked in favor of those already at the top. And there's something wrong with that. There's something wrong when CEOs make 300 times more than the typical worker. There's something wrong when American workers keep getting more productive, as they have, and as I just saw a few minutes ago, is very possibly possible because of education and stills training, but that productivity is not matched in their paychecks. And there's something wrong when hedge fund managers pay lower tax rates than nurses or the truckers that I saw on I-80 as I was driving here the last two days. And there's something wrong when students and their families have to go deeply into debt to be able to get the education and skills in order to make the best of their own lives. I looked at the figures. The average Iowa graduate from a four-year college comes out with nearly $30,000 in debt. And that's I think the ninth-highest debt load in the country. And people are struggling. I met earlier today with a young student who is piecing together work and loans, knowing full well he's going to come out owing a lot of money.
We're got to figure out in our country how to get back on the right track. And I'm running for president because I think that Americans and their families need a champion, and I want to be this champion. I want to stand up and fight for people so that they cannot just get by, but they get ahead and they can stay ahead. And a lot of people in the last few days have asking why do you want to do this? What motivates you? I thought a lot about it and I guess the short answer is I've been fighting for children and families my entire adult life, probably because of my mother's example. She had a really difficult childhood, was mistreated, neglected, but she never gave up. She had to basically be on her own at the time she was 14 but she just kept going. My father, who was a small business man, believed you had to work hard to make your way and do what you had to do to be successful, and provided a good living for our family. And then I was thinking, too, about the lessons from my church. You're supposed to give back. You're supposed to do what you can to help others. And that's what I tried to do. And we'll have more time to talk about as that as we go forward.
When I got out of law school, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund. One of the projects there was literally going door to door. This was back in the '70s when kids with disabilities were basically shut out of our schools. And thanks to your great former Senator, Tom Harkin, that's no longer the case. But I was knocking on doors asking is there anybody school age not in school, and finding blind kids and deaf kids and kids in wheel chairs who were just left out. And I was able in Arkansas to work to try to improve education there and give more kids chances who really deserved them. And as first lady, to fight for health care reform and keep fighting until we get health care insurance for kids. Then as Senator, dealing with the problems that faced New York after 9/11 and trying to help people get what they needed, the victims' families and first responders. It was an incredible honor to do that. Then, as secretary of state, standing up for our country.
So when I look at where we are as a country, I'm so absolutely convinced that there isn't anybody anywhere who can outcompete us, who has better values, who can do more to provide more people the chance to live up to their own God-given potential. But we can't take that for granted. So I want to be the champion who goes to bat for Americans in four big areas, four big fights that I think we have to take on, because there are those who don't agree with what I think we should be doing. And they're pretty powerful forces.
We need to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. We need to strengthen families and communities because that's where it all starts. We need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all, even if that takes a constitutional amendment, and we need to protect our country from the threats that we see and the ones that are on the horizon.
So I'm here in Iowa to begin a conversation about how we do that and to hear from people about what's on your minds, what the challenges that you see are. And I'll work hard to meet as many people. I'll be rolling out ideas and policies about what I think will work. But I want it to be informed by what's actually working and to build on what works going forward, and to stand up for those who have a different vision of our country, a different one than what I grew up with and a different one than I think is best for everybody.
So with that what I'd love to do is just, you know, ask a few questions and hear...[end of transcript]

2,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5000,"April 20, 2015","Remarks in Keene, New Hampshire",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=110045,Hillary Clinton,"Clinton: Well, thank you all so much for inviting me here today and giving me a chance to not only learn more about this business, which is a family business, 112 years young.
Unknown: That's right.
Clinton: And to meet some of the people who work here, as I did when I was walking through, and as you've just introduced yourself. I am excited to hear from you about what it takes to get a small business up and going and keep it growing in an increasingly competitive global economy.
Small business is the backbone of the American economy. Here in New Hampshire, 96 percent of all businesses are considered small businesses. And they employ more than half of the workers, the employees, in the state of New Hampshire. So New Hampshire is a perfect example of what it takes to start and grow a small business.
And I come from a small business family. My father had a very small business. He printed drapery fabrics in a print plant. And he did much of the work himself, sometimes with day laborers, sometimes with my mother and my brothers and me, literally, taking the squeegee, pour the paint on the silk screen. You take the squeegee, you go down, then you lift it up and you go to the next and you keep going.
And I saw where now there's a machine that you just bought that's printing on all kinds of material. And I'm thinking back to those years in my father's small print plant. But he made a very good living because of his hard work and his absolute willingness to do whatever it took to design, to produce, to sell the products that were at the heart of what he produced.
And so from my perspective, I want to be sure that we get small businesses starting and growing in America again. We have stalled out. I was very surprised to see that when I began to dig into it, because people were telling me this, as I traveled around the country the last two years, but I didn't know what they were saying.
And it turns out that we're not producing as many small businesses as we used to. And a recent world study said that we are 46th in the world in the difficulty to start a small business. There are lots of issues and we'll get into some of those, I hope, Dave, and the rest of you, as well.
So I want to hear from each of you, because part of what I'm doing in this campaign is making my own decisions about what we need to do. I want to embed what I propose as policies, not in ideology, not in some philosophy, but in the real daily lives and experiences of American workers and business owners and everybody who had a stake in making sure that the economy is working again. Really, we have to do more for young people, because what we're finding is that with student debt — and New Hampshire has the highest student debt numbers of any state in the country — that interferes with the young people taking certain jobs, buying a house, even getting married and certainly starting a business.
When I was in Iowa last week, I met a young man, who — his dream had been to own a bowling center is his hometown. He graduated from college, because he'd worked, like you, during the summers, and he — and he wanted to own that business. He got a chance to do it.
With his student debt, it was really a struggle, because even though he was very responsible, he had done everything we expect a young person to do to try to better himself, he was running into real credit problems.
And even now, he's got the business, but he runs it — he has a little grill and restaurant, he, with two employees, is trying to make a go of it. Here's a young, ambitious guy. And when I think about my dad, it was a lot easier in those days to have an idea, to get what you needed and to go to work.
The other piece of this, as we were walking around and Dave was telling about all of the incredible machines that are used here in production, all but one are from another country. And many of them, if I'm right, Dave, are from Europe.
Unknown: That's correct.
Clinton: And so you think — I mean, Europe has high wages. They have high costs. Why are they producing these advanced machines instead of us? What's wrong with this picture?
You can — you can see that maybe lower-cost places that are mastering the art of machine production would be competitive, but these are high-value machines. These are very sophisticated machines.
How do we get that into more basic production again so that we can resume our lead in manufacturing, something that I think is essential? A lot of people disagree with me. They say, ""Oh, you know, those days are over."" I don't believe it.
You walk around here, you see these machines from, you know, Italy or Germany or wherever else they're from. Why? Why aren't we producing those machines? What do we need to do to jump-start advanced manufacturing once again in our country?
So my bottom line is, we've gone through some tough times, and I think Americans have done everything they could think of to do to get through those tough times.
But now it's not enough just to tread water; we need to get ahead and stay ahead, and people need to feel that their work is being rewarded, that the deck is not stacked in favor of those at the top, that they too have a chance to go as far as their hard work and their aspiration will take them.
So in order to put together a set of policies for my campaign, I really want to make sure that they are in line with the real lives and the real working experiences of the people that I would love to represent as your president.
So we're going to take on four big fights. You know, we're going to fight to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday, and make the middle class mean something again in this country. We're going to fight to have strong families and strong communities. And of course, it's no accident that I'm at a [inaudible] whose customer market is between six months and six years. That's — that's right where I am focused these days.
I want to make sure we have a functioning political system. I'm going to fight for that.
I will work with anybody. I've done that. I did it as senator. I will do it again.
But I will also stand my ground when we need to, and part of that is getting unaccountable money out of politics, because we cannot afford that, even if it takes a constitutional amendment.
And then finally, we always have to be vigilant to protect our country against the threats we know — we can see them — but then the threats we can't see — pandemic diseases, cyber warfare, et cetera.
So I'm excited about this campaign. I'm thrilled to be back in New Hampshire. I see some of my friends out there in the audience.
And the first place I ever came for any political campaign was in 1991 when I was here campaigning for my husband, in October of 1991. I celebrated my birthday here in — in Keene, and I have a lot of wonderful memories.
So with that, Dave, I'm going to turn it back to you, and — and we can start hearing from some of the folks.
Question: I think maybe I'll ask the initial question, and you guys will chime in.
But — but, you know, early childhood is obviously our interest and — our selfish interest, but also, we're fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters. And I would like you to elaborate on exactly what you think you might do for child-care in the future if — if you're — you know, if you're elected.
Clinton: Well, that's a question near and dear to my heart, because I think every society starts with our youngest citizens. And when I got out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. And so my whole adult life, both professionally and my volunteer work, has been around children and families and it is to me the most important commitment we can make.
And now it's not only that we want to take care of our children and our grandchildren, but we now know that the way brains develop, thanks to all the great research that is being done by our scientists, that those early years really are critical to the success that a child will have in school and what that child can learn and then what that child can choose to do, what kind of opportunities will be available.
So I think we have to start in the family. And I've been working on a project to convince parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, to read, talk and sing to their babies and that's equally important in any child care setting.
So when you are producing furniture that give kids a chance to be part of a circle, to work on a table, all of that, it's safety and stimulation are the two most important needs that little, tiny babies have. And I think we need a much more broadly based universal pre- Kindergarten program so that kids have a chance to get ready for school.
And I really applaud states — and they are not — you know, they're not all the states that you might think of — Oklahoma has a universal pre-K program because their state decided they would invest in those early years to get their kids better for school.
And I think the child care problem, I was looking at a statistic that it can cost as much as $12,000 a year in New Hampshire for quality child care. That's more than the community college costs, as I understand it.
And what are we going to do about that?
How can you expect, you know, most families to afford that kind of cost?
So we've got to do more to support quality child care and universal pre-kindergarten because by the time a child enters kindergarten, a lot of their brain development has taken place, their vocabulary has been developed and so if we want to do well in school — and I know there's a couple teachers or retired teachers out there, you want to have our kids do well in school, it has to start in those first five years and that's where you come in.
And you were telling me about a light table and other things that you prepare for settings where little kids are — that's all to stimulate them and give them a chance to develop that brain and learn more so they are better prepared for school.
Question: Yes. Thank you.
Guys, you want to start off, anybody?
Question: Well, my grandson goes to the Head Start across the way over there [inaubible] in there it's filled with Whitney Brothers products, all down the hallways. They're all on coat lockers. In there are all their — are little tables and chairs. And it made me feel so proud that I worked here, that these people were buying [inaubible].
[audio gap]
Question: — more for substance abuse, help in our area, there's very limited resources here. And we would like to see something in that respect.
Do you have —
Clinton: Well — Question: — any further ideas?
Clinton: I do, actually. I am — I'm really concerned because, Pam, what you just told me, I'm hearing from a lot of different people. There is a hidden epidemic. You know, the drug abuse problem, whether it's pills or meth or heroin, is not as visible as in, you know, 30 years ago when there were all kinds of gangs and violence. This is a quiet epidemic. And it is striking in small towns and rural areas as much as any big city. And at the same time, we see steady cutbacks in drug abuse programs, treatment programs, mental health programs. I see Senator Kelly here and I know how committed she is to trying to get resources.
So we're — we've got a perfect storm. We have an increasing problem that's only beginning to break through the service so that people — you know, I think a lot of people are thinking, well, that's somebody else's problem, it's not my problem and indeed it is all of our problem. And we don't have enough resources, so that if somebody decides that they want to get help, where do you send them?
What kind of opportunities do they have for treatment?
And I am convinced that the mental health issues — because I consider substance abuse part of mental health issues — is going to be a big part of my campaign because increasingly it's a big issue that people raised with me.
And when I was in Iowa last week, I literally heard from one end of the state, from Davenport to Council Bluffs, about this problem and how the state was shutting all their inpatient facilities and there was nowhere for people to be sent.
So we've got to do more. We have treatment in the Affordable Care Act, which is a good thing, which we — and we have at least on paper, what's called mental health parity, you know, insurance companies have to care of mental health just like they take care of physical problems.
But we are just at the beginning of trying to figure out what this is, and the whole substance abuse issue — I'll just end with this. You probably have read about this small county in Southern Indiana where there was an epidemic of HIV among just people living in the community because they were sharing needles and shooting up some kind of pill that was I guess turned to powder.
So now they have not only the drug abuse problem, they have people who contracted HIV. So this is not something we can just brush under the rug and wish it would go away. We need a concerted policy, national, state, local, public, private and we need to try to help young people like the mother of your grandson.
Question: Thank you.
Question: Well, the drug issue is not really a no-issue here. I mean, as a kid myself, as the son of a minister, of a preacher, the little town that I grew up in, I was the only kid my age who was not involved in drugs of some sort. The dealer lived across the street, the kids used their drugs in the front lawn of the house next door. I mean — and there was no — really no recourse in upstate New York at that time because this little town of 300,000 acres, one town cop, two local sheriffs, that's a lot of territory to cover.
So it's not really a no issue but it is certainly an ongoing issue.
Clinton: You know, that's exactly right. It's not a new issue, but it's taken a new — kind of a new turn, if you will. And I think more young people — maybe because we stopped the messaging about how dangerous drugs work, because I can remember the same kind of, you know, messages advertising that we would see all the time, you don't see that anymore.
And so I think for a lot of young people, especially if it's pills, I think they believe, well, what's wrong with that? I mean, you know it's a prescription pill so that means it must be OK. And they don't know that taking it and mixing it and all the rest is going to be dangerous for them. That's a good point. Yes.
Question: Bill?
Question: Well, I was in the line with the drugs and things, you made a point that educating the kids at an early age, it might be advantageous to really push the drug issue there at Head Start, you know, just in a — in a way that they'll understand it, no, it's not a good thing to do, even though your friends might do it. You don't need to do this. You don't have to. There's other ways.
Clinton: Yes, so starting early.
Question: Start it early.
Clinton: And, Chris, you hire a lot of people, so you see this, don't you and —
Question: Yes. Whitney Brothers actually does drug testing. It's a pre-employment drug testing in order to come to work here, so we want a drug-free workplace.
Clinton: Well, I think that sends a strong message and a lot of employers are either doing that or thinking about that going back to doing it, from what I'm hearing.
Is that what you hear from your human resource contacts as well?
Question: Yes. And Workmen's Comp likes having it, too, because we haven't [inaubible] machines that people are running and if they're high, running them and obviously there's going to be — someone's going to get hurt.
Coordination and everything goes downhill.
Clinton: Yes.
What are some of the other issues?
Jim, like, what's on your mind economically and kind of how you see things for yourself and your family?
Question: Well, thank you. Because my kids are all grown and they're in their late 20s so they're — have established themselves and they're doing their thing, so I don't have to worry about them anymore in the way I used to with young kids. But for myself, I'm getting, you know, up in age and looking for — I've worked for small companies all my life. And most of them have just enough money to give you minimal health care, to, you know, retirement. I have very little saved for retirement because of you know, trying to make ends meet with kids and you know, it's [inaubible] the resources. And the company I just left before I came here a year ago closed their doors because of the economy — they were — they were making super insulated panels for the building industry, which I thought was the way to go.
And so when they closed their doors, I was 27 years working for them, left me with — looking for a new job and thankfully [inaubible] you know, Whitney Brothers were looking for my skills to help them with their products and I'm very thankful for being here.
But you know, I look at, you know, hope your ideas on health care and Social Security and you know, where are those — where are those heading? [inaubible] probably I'm in my late 50s right now and you know, 10 years from now I'm going to hopefully work less. You know, what's going to — you know, and so, in regards to our company here, [inaubible], what could be done to help you know, bolster our company here to help us all live a little better life?
Clinton: Can I ask you, you worked for 27 years.
Was there any kind of retirement account, kind of [inaubible] 401(k), anything?
Question: There was initially; that lasted until the economy went belly up back in 2008. And you know, our company went right down the tubes. So it was, you know, people weren't going to, you know, to spend that extra little bit of money to get a better — a better product.
And you know, the same what happens here. I mean, we're struggling to try to fight with, you know, the Chinese and other people who are making similar items to us and are, you know, cutting costs and we're, you know, we look at every penny that we put into the — into our products here and try to you know, get everything out of it we can with the CSN machines, with the — with the processes that we use.
So, yes, the company I work for was — I always thought was the way to go.
Clinton: Well, you know, you really raised an important issue because one of the really big problems we face is that American worker productivity has continued to go up. American workers work longer and harder and more productively than the vast majority of workers anywhere in the world.
But it's been very difficult to turn that increased productivity into increased wages and increased benefits. And in some cases, where you have small companies, it's— the margin's just too thin. You know, it's really hard to do that. In some places where you have big companies, they just choose not to. They'd rather stock buybacks than increase the, you know, the wages and salaries of the people who've actually contributed to the productivity and the profits.
So I think there has to be a look at the range of different kinds of companies because some companies have the cash and they make decisions that leave out their workers and some people are trying just to keep the doors open and the work coming and be successful and stay afloat.
So what we need to figure out is how we incentivize companies that have the cash to do more with it and how we support smaller businesses to be more competitive, to get more market, especially export market.
And Dave and I were talking about how important it is for small businesses to have access to market openings. I mean, how do you get the best support you need for a website or for you know, telling other potential customers about your product?
How do you compete with, as you say, somebody doing the same thing in China?
So I think we have to look at this from kind of the top and the middle and try to figure out what's the best way to do it.
On Social Security, though, you know, there is a lot of loose talk about Social Security. And I don't know how people can make some of the arguments they make, because if you look at how dependent so many people are on their Social Security — they've worked hard for it, they retire, they postpone retirement as long as possible because they want to keep working, but they also want to, you know, get the maximum amount of payout from Social Security.
You know, the Social Security trust fund, according to the trustees, will be solvent until 2035. So what do we do to make sure it is there and we don't mess with it and we don't, you know, pretend that it's a luxury, because it's not a luxury. It's a necessity for the majority of people who draw from Social Security.
So I think there will be some big political arguments about Social Security. And my only question to everybody who thinks we can privatize Social Security or, you know, undermine it in some way is — and so then what's going to happen to all these people like you, who worked 27 years at this other company?
What's going to happen? It's just wrong.
So part of what we have to do is say, look, let's everybody take a deep breath. Let's figure out what works and how we build on what works. And let's not get into arguments, as I say, about ideology and rhetorical, you know, attacks and claims. Let's just kind of take a deep breath here as a country and say, OK, we're going to have a retirement issue and people who have worked hard deserve to have enough security when they retire so that they can have a good quality of life. And so I'm 100 percent committed to that.
Question: That sort of dovetails with what Mary's situation — and I don't know your whole circumstances, Mary, but you know, Mary worked here for a number of years, quit, and then come back. If you could just talk briefly about why you came back and was it a — was it a financial decision or was just because you were bored or what?
Question: Actually, it was a financial situation. As a homeowner there's always overhead that have to be done, those things you have to keep up that you don't really count on when you're not working. So coming back to work and I said I have, why not come back to Whitney Brothers? It's a place that I know I'm familiar with, I like it and I like the product. [inaubible] financially.
Clinton: Did you think, Mary, when you retired the first time that you had enough resources to be able to take care of your needs and then something unexpected happened?
Question: Yes.
Clinton: OK.
Question: Yes.
Clinton: OK.
Are you —
Question: I thought I could — I could live like comfortable, not above but comfortable.
Clinton: What — did you start drawing Social Security?
Question: Yes.
Clinton: What did you get a month, do you — do you remember what you were drawing on Social Security?
Question: [inaubible]?
Clinton: Yes, when you started?
[crosstalk]
Question: You don't remember what you — what amount you were [inaubible] amount?
Question: Yes, yes.
Question: [inaubible] amount.
Well, I also had a retirement, too, but I dropped from a Social Security $1,400.
Clinton: $1,400 a month? OK.
Question: Yes.
Clinton: So I think that, you know, if you — if you look just realistically, especially if you still own your home, you're still obviously very independent and able to take care of yourself, you are going to have a lot of expenses, both predicted and unpredictable.
So when you came back, did you believe that you were here for a period of years, or are you going to —
Question: Just —
Clinton: — take it year by year?
Question: — yes, part-time.
Clinton: OK, part-time. All right.
Question: Going to catch up on those [inaubible].
[laughter]
Clinton: I can tell, yes. They were calling you every day, saying, why don't you come back?
It really was a — it was really unexpected expense, right?
Question: Her kind of experience, you know, being here so many years, it's really priceless, I mean — and that brings up something I would like to have you address and that — one of the biggest problems we have, Madam Secretary, is getting good CNC adult center trained in math and computers and, you know, we're — we compete against a lot of local companies that are — you know, you look at our ads in the local newspapers or on the Internet, I mean, i is CNC folks, it's a — people that have math skills. You know, we're — our machines are metric and our — the architects and dealers are in standards so where we're switching. So you need intelligent employees. And you know, we have the college and the high school do have technical services.
But it just doesn't seem to be [inaubible] we're always struggling to find people like that.
Would you agree?
Question: Yes, I do agree.
Question: Yes.
So I mean, what —
Clinton: Well, I met — I met a young man, I don't know if he's out here —
Question: Dan? Dan Brown, somewhere?
Clinton: — yes, he went to the Keene State College program to learn these skills and that's what we need more of, right. You need at the high school and the college level, community, four-year college, more programs that are related to the skills that employers actually need.
You know, what are the job skills that you are trying to —
[crosstalk]
Question: It's technical skills, it's —
[crosstalk]
Question: — I think there is a place for the humanities, but it's the technical skills, the electricians, the plumbers, those are the guys that we're looking for, and those are the people.
Clinton: Well, I think we have to get back to encouraging more young people to see these as careers and then we have to have both more education-based skills programs and employer-based skills programs, you know, the kind of apprenticeship programs and other training programs that are both public and private and try to give young people the opportunities.
It's really important that we do more to publicize why these skills are going to get you a good job. I think we have kind of lost the thread here. Too many young people don't know — nobody's told them that, you know, you can get a really good job, as you just named, an electrician or a welder, you name it — and the computerized numeric control systems that you're talking about on these big machines, that takes, you know, a year or two of training to really understand, because that's a level beyond what we typically think of as technical education.
So I would love to hear from you — and maybe start with you, indeed, Chris, because when people come for a job interview, where have they gotten their skills or do they even know that those skills would enhance their chance to get hired?
Question: I think the majority of the people that come here, on the job training, they've been other places so they've done — it's not really any tool change.
There is a career center at the high school, but it's more metal and more wood. It — you know, it can go hand in hand, but with us, we look more for wood and it's more on-the-job training that people [inaubible].
Question: Yes, so we're having to train relatively green people to run the machines. And it has worked out, but, I mean, again, you know, in the — in the local marketplace, we are competing against a lot of different companies that are — that need CNC operators. So you know, we might train someone for a year or two and they might go somewhere else for a couple of dollars more. And that — I mean, that's life, that's tough, but we would like to think that there could be a greater pool of technical — technically skilled people in this —
[crosstalk]
Question: Hard for us to retain the CNC operators because with — we are doing wood manufacturing and we are going against the overseas people. So we need to keep our costs low and we only can pay so much [inaubible].
Clinton: Yes, so you have got cost pressures plus skill pressures.
Question: Right.
Clinton: Well, I think, first of all, we just have to have more programs that are going to prepare more people. I mean, that sounds so simplistic, but we kind of backed off from what used to be called vocational education and I think that we made a mistake because we backed off, thinking that it was going to be picked up by either businesses or community colleges, technical schools and that didn't happen fast enough. It's starting to happen now. There are more and more places where you can get these kind of advanced skills, but we need to create a bigger pool of people in order to meet the needs that you are talking about.
I visited a community college in Iowa last year that takes high school students and trains them on CNC. And then they are able to really be job prepared when they leave high school, which is amazing. But they still have a relatively — they might graduate — I think they told me 30 or 40 a year, when the demand is much greater than that.
So I think we have to take up — I really approve of the president's proposal to try to make community college as free as possible. That would be a big help here in New Hampshire, where it's so costly. I mean, the amount of tuition is so high, both in the two- year and the four-year schools, but that still doesn't help unless we somehow provide incentives for more people, younger and older, to go into these trades, right.
Question: Yes, I was just going to, you know, comment on, you know, being as if I had to switch jobs again for some reason, thank God I have — still have decent skills. As a — as a draftsman and designer, you know, I learned how to, you know, use the computer on my own without any education, which if I had more education, I might have been able to do more.
But to afford to go back to school, time wise as well as cost, is always hard, especially like say with health care and all that, you know, taking the little bits out of my pay, that there isn't any money for me to go back to school to try to get other new skills, to — and need to either enhance what I am doing here or to think about, you know, if I ever decided to move somewhere else.
Question: Before I came to Whitney Brothers I had actually looked into a CNC program that's offered by the local community college, but it was only going to be in Clermont that next session and of course that was the middle of winter. And it's a bit of a hike up there.
[crosstalk]
Question: Fortunately, I found this place and it worked out very well.
Clinton: Now what are your hours of operation?
Question: We're 7:00 to 3:30 but we're always doing overtime. So it goes to 4:30, sometimes 5:00, so it's eight or nine hours. And then during the summer occasionally we have skeleton crews on the second shift, because our — the nature of our business is the busy months are June, July and August and September, before school starts.
Clinton: I mean, I'm just thinking that you know, you have this equipment here, if you get some kind of grant or other support from either local government, state government, even the community college or the colleges and you know, you could have a program at night. I mean, it — you know, if somebody were to come in and basically say we are going to designate Whitney Brothers as one of our training facilities and your expert employees would get some kind of wage bump because you would be the instructors.
I just think we've got to be imagining outside the old box about what we're going to do to get our skills up, how we're going to get more people of all ages to have the opportunity to improve those skills. Very hard to do it if you're already working during the workday — but maybe there could be some, you know, cooperative approach that might make a difference. I just — from my perspective, I hear it everywhere. I hear we don't have enough skilled workers, with technical skills. We don't have enough R.N.s and CNAs. We have a whole missing group of workers that could be employed you know, in our existing industries, and so how do we fix that? Because we don't fix it, we're not going to be able to be competitive. We're always going to be, you know, behind the curve in trying to succeed [inaubible].
Question: Going back to changing the mindset, I mean, when I was in school and growing up, there was nothing wrong with being an electrician or a plumber or a carpenter. I mean, these were really good jobs and you know, you could make good money doing that. And it seemed to fall off the table. Everybody wants to go right to the top. Well, no, you got to be at the bottom before you can kind of work your way in there.
And I think if we work in the high schools, even in the grammar schools in some points, you know, get these kids — a lot of kids just don't want to go to school. They don't want to go to college. You know, well, fine, you don't have to go to college to make a good living. But you have to get it out there, that it's OK not to go to college if you don't want to, but these are good positions. You can get a good job, you can make a good living, support your family by doing these other things. And I think that kind of got off track. Clinton: I agree with you.
Does anybody else feel that way?
Question: When I was in high school, we had to have at least a semester or two of shop classes.
Clinton: When I was, too. Yes.
Question: Everything it seems got computerized and everybody wants either sit with their gadgets or, oh, I'll design computer games. That's what I'm good at. I love — I'd love to do it. And [inaubible] do that. But you know, it is true, you need a nurse. You're going to get sick sometime, you know, we all want to live somewhere. We got to have these people building our houses. And we want to be here working at Whitney Brothers, you know.
[laughter]
Question: You've got to have that —
Question: Somebody has got to be making the —
Question: — at night when your [inaubible]
[crosstalk]
Question: Somebody's got to fix it. Yes.
Question: Yes.
Question: That we're not all computer geeks. I don't think I could be one if I tried.
[laughter]
Question: You know? You just — you have to find your fit, you know. But I think the generation coming up needs that push to say, well, you know, here are some of these other things to do besides sit in front of a computer your whole entire life.
Question: Yes.
Clinton: You know, one of the kids that they told me about at this community college, advanced manufacturing program, graduated from high school and got a $40,000 job as a welder because there was such a shortage. And he'd had a two-year program, passed some kind of national certification. So here he is, like 18 years old and you know, starting off on a really good track. Yes.
Question: There was some — you probably know more about it than I do, but I heard it, that there are several high schools in Chicago that are affiliated with like IBM is one of them, one of their companies and it's an eight-year program, it's not four years and these kids are trained through high school and into this extended high school, as it were, being mentored by IBM. And when they get done, they are guaranteed a job at $40,000 a year in the company. And so, you know, you don't have to go to the University of Illinois. You're going to get your training right here. And I think five out of the eight schools in the country are in Chicago.
Clinton: Well, that's exactly the kind of model that we need to look at and try to see where we could implement that. I think we have to try all different kinds of approaches and first it's to figure out what's already working and do more of that. And then I think you make a very strong point, we have to persuade, particularly young people, that this is an opportunity, that this is part of the economy that really needs them.
And yes, some might want to be computer programmers and some might want to be the best welder or the best plumber. But we have to make it once again attractive for young people to feel like that's a good route for them.
Well, Dave, we will give you the last word because you have been here — how long have you worked here?
Question: Thirty-two years.
Clinton: Yes.
Question: A long time.
Question: A long time.
Question: But it's been great. I mean, it's a wonderful industry. And you know, I get to do R&D work by going to child care centers. And you know, you get little 3- and 4-year olds running around. And you know, it really is quite a — I have an enviable job. And then, but you know, we — I am still a small business owner and as such I have the 3M worries also.
So it's not all peach and cream. Actually, you know, in 2006 we had a flood and we had — actually there was about two feet of water where we're sitting. And the SBA was great to give us a low-interest loan. So kudos to the SBA.
But I guess one final question I might ask you is that capital improvements, you know, we like keeping our machines monitored and up to date and historically, I think the last 8-10 years we have been able to write off the capital improvements in the year that they were installed and now in 2015, they're talking about reducing that to $25,000.
And I know that's Congress, but I'm curious as to your feeling. I mean, if you are president, are you — what can you do to help small businesses like ours to improve the equipment that we have and not make it so onerous that — so that we can — we can spread it out and still do right by the IRS?
Clinton: Yes, no, I think that's an important question and I can assure you that I don't want to make your life any more onerous. I want you to be able to invest in both maintenance and upgrading of existing equipment and, like that new printing machine you showed me, new equipment, if that's going to make you competitive.
I think what we have to do is we have to look at the whole tax system and try to figure out what is an economic investment as opposed to one without economic purpose, because there are a lot of those, where people are just basically playing games and — you know, not — you know, like capital gains was supposed to be, for example, a way to reward people who made risky investments, you know, starting new business, investing in somebody else's business and now it's just being churned. And so we have to take a look at the whole tax system.
But I can — I can assure you, I would not support anything that makes your business more difficult to run, because you have a real business and you have real economic imperatives. You are in the production of goods and I want to do everything I can to support goods and real services and take a hard look at what is now being done in the trading world, you know, which is just trading for the sake of trading. And you know, it's just wrong that you know, a hedge fund manager pays lower tax rates than a nurse or a trucker or an assembly worker here at Whitney Brothers.
And so I think we have to say, look, if you're doing something which is enhancing the economic productivity of your business and the larger economy, we'll be open to that, but if it's just you know, playing back and forth in the global marketplace to get you know, 0.1 of 1 percent advantage, maybe we should not let that go on. Because that is unfortunately kind of at the root of some of the economic problems that we all remember painfully from '08.
So I think that, from your perspective, I would want to be a president who made it as easy as possible for you to be as productive and profitable as possible because you've got 40-plus people whose lives and families depend upon that.
Question: Yes.
Clinton: Right?
Question: Yes, absolutely.
Clinton: Yes.
Question: Yes.
Well, great. It's been great to have you here.
Clinton: Yes, thank you.
Question: Thank you all for coming.
I know the secretary has got a busy schedule, so I think — I'm not quite sure how this works from here.
Clinton: Well, I think what we'd like to do is a picture with everybody who was in the roundtable. And then, you know, I want to say hello to some of my friends who are here.

Dinkins Leadership & Public Policy Forum at Columbia University in New York City,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=110274,Hillary Clinton,"Thank you so much. I am absolutely delighted to be back here at Columbia. I want to thank President Bollinger, Dean Janow, and everyone at the School of International and Public Affairs. It is a special treat to be here with and on behalf of a great leader of this city and our country, David Dinkins. He has made such an indelible impact on New York, and I had the great privilege of working with him as First Lady and then, of course, as a new senator.
When I was just starting out as a senator, David's door was always open. He and his wonderful wife Joyce were great friends and supporters and good sounding boards about ideas that we wanted to consider to enhance the quality of life and the opportunities for the people of this city. I was pleased to address the Dinkins Leadership and Public Policy Forum in my first year as a senator, and I so appreciated then as I have in the years since David's generosity with his time and most of all his wisdom. So 14 years later, I'm honored to have this chance, once again, to help celebrate the legacy of one of New York's greatest public servants.
I'm pleased too that you will have the opportunity after my remarks to hear from such a distinguished panel, to go into more detail about some of the issues that we face. I also know that Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer is here, along with other local and community leaders.
Because surely this is a time when our collective efforts to devise approaches to the problems that still afflict us is more important than ever. Indeed, it is a time for wisdom.
For yet again, the family of a young black man is grieving a life cut short.
Yet again, the streets of an American city are marred by violence. By shattered glass and shouts of anger and shows of force.
Yet again a community is reeling, its fault lines laid bare and its bonds of trust and respect frayed.
Yet again, brave police officers have been attacked in the line of duty.
What we've seen in Baltimore should, indeed does, tear at our soul.
And, from Ferguson to Staten Island to Baltimore, the patterns have become unmistakable and undeniable.
Walter Scott shot in the back in Charleston, South Carolina. Unarmed. In debt. And terrified of spending more time in jail for child support payments he couldn't afford.
Tamir Rice shot in a park in Cleveland, Ohio. Unarmed and just 12 years old.
Eric Garner choked to death after being stopped for selling cigarettes on the streets of this city.
And now Freddie Gray. His spine nearly severed while in police custody.
Not only as a mother and a grandmother but as a citizen, a human being, my heart breaks for these young men and their families.
We have to come to terms with some hard truths about race and justice in America.
There is something profoundly wrong when African American men are still far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than are meted out to their white counterparts.
There is something wrong when a third of all black men face the prospect of prison during their lifetimes. And an estimated 1.5 million black men are ""missing"" from their families and communities because of incarceration and premature death.
There is something wrong when more than one out of every three young black men in Baltimore can't find a job.
There is something wrong when trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve breaks down as far as it has in many of our communities.
We have allowed our criminal justice system to get out of balance. And these recent tragedies should galvanize us to come together as a nation to find our balance again.
We should begin by heeding the pleas of Freddie Gray's family for peace and unity, echoing the families of Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, and others in the past years.
Those who are instigating further violence in Baltimore are disrespecting the Gray family and the entire community. They are compounding the tragedy of Freddie Gray's death and setting back the cause of justice. So the violence has to stop.
But more broadly, let's remember that everyone in every community benefits when there is respect for the law and when everyone in every community is respected by the law. That is what we have to work towards in Baltimore and across our country.
We must urgently begin to rebuild the bonds of trust and respect among Americans. Between police and citizens, yes, but also across society.
Restoring trust in our politics, our press, our markets. Between and among neighbors and even people with whom we disagree politically.
This is so fundamental to who we are as a nation and everything we want to achieve together.
It truly is about how we treat each other and what we value. Making it possible for every American to reach his or her God-given potential—regardless of who you are, where you were born, or who you love.
The inequities that persist in our justice system undermine this shared vision of what America can be and should be.
I learned this firsthand as a young attorney just out of law school—at one of those law schools that will remain nameless here at Columbia. One of my earliest jobs for the Children's Defense Fund, which David had mentioned—I was so fortunate to work with Marian Wright Edelman as a young lawyer and then serving on the board of the Children's Defense Fund—was studying the problem then of youth, teenagers, sometimes preteens, incarcerated in adult jails. Then, as director of the University of Arkansas School of Law's legal aid clinic, I advocated on behalf of prison inmates and poor families.
I saw repeatedly how our legal system can be and all too often is stacked against those who have the least power, who are the most vulnerable.
I saw how families could be and were torn apart by excessive incarceration. I saw the toll on children growing up in homes shattered by poverty and prison.
So, unfortunately, I know these are not new challenges by any means.
In fact they have become even more complex and urgent over time. And today they demand fresh thinking and bold action from all of us.
Today there seems to be a growing bipartisan movement for commonsense reforms in our criminal justice systems. Senators as disparate on the political spectrum as Cory Booker and Rand Paul and Dick Durbin and Mike Lee are reaching across the aisle to find ways to work together. It is rare to see Democrats and Republicans agree on anything today. But we're beginning to agreeing on this: We need to restore balance to our criminal justice system.
Now of course it is not enough just to agree and give speeches about it—we actually have to work together to get the job done.
We need to deliver real reforms that can be felt on our streets, in our courthouses, and our jails and prisons, in communities too long neglected.
Let me touch on two areas in particular where I believe we need to push for more progress.
First, we need smart strategies to fight crime that help restore trust between law enforcement and our communities, especially communities of color.
There's a lot of good work to build on. Across the country, there are so many police officers out there every day inspiring trust and confidence, honorably doing their duty, putting themselves on the line to save lives. There are police departments already deploying creative and effective strategies, demonstrating how we can protect the public without resorting to unnecessary force. We need to learn from those examples, build on what works.
We can start by making sure that federal funds for state and local law enforcement are used to bolster best practices, rather than to buy weapons of war that have no place on our streets.
President Obama's task force on policing gives us a good place to start. Its recommendations offer a roadmap for reform, from training to technology, guided by more and better data.
We should make sure every police department in the country has body cameras to record interactions between officers on patrol and suspects.
That will improve transparency and accountability, it will help protect good people on both sides of the lens. For every tragedy caught on tape, there surely have been many more that remained invisible. Not every problem can be or will be prevented with cameras, but this is a commonsense step we should take.
The President has provided the idea of matching funds to state and local governments investing in body cameras. We should go even further and make this the norm everywhere.
And we should listen to law enforcement leaders who are calling for a renewed focus on working with communities to prevent crime, rather than measuring success just by the number of arrests or convictions.
As your Senator from New York, I supported a greater emphasis on community policing, along with putting more officers on the street to get to know those communities.
David Dinkins was an early pioneer of this policy. His leadership helped lay the foundation for dramatic drops in crime in the years that followed.
And today smart policing in communities that builds relationships, partnerships, and trust makes more sense than ever.
And it shouldn't be limited just to officers on the beat. It's an ethic that should extend throughout our criminal justice system. To prosecutors and parole officers. To judges and lawmakers.
We all share a responsibility to help re-stitch the fabric of our neighborhoods and communities.
We also have to be honest about the gaps that exist across our country, the inequality that stalks our streets. Because you cannot talk about smart policing and reforming the criminal justice system if you also don't talk about what's needed to provide economic opportunity, better educational chances for young people, more support to families so they can do the best jobs they are capable of doing to help support their own children.
Today I saw an article on the front page of USA Today that really struck me, written by a journalist who lives in Baltimore. And here's what I read three times to make sure I was reading correctly: ""At a conference in 2013 at Johns Hopkins University, Vice Provost Jonathan Bagger pointed out that 'only six miles separate the Baltimore neighborhoods of Roland Park and Hollins Market. But there is a 20-year difference in the average life expectancy.'""
We have learned in the last few years that life expectancy, which is a measure of the quality of life in communities and countries, manifests the same inequality that we see in so many other parts of our society.
Women—white women without high school education—are losing life expectancy. Black men and black women are seeing their life expectancy goes down in so many parts of our country.
This may not grab headlines, although I was glad to see it on the front page of USA Today. But it tells us more than I think we can bear about what we are up against.
We need to start understanding how important it is to care for every single child as though that child were our own.
David and I started our conversation this morning talking about our grandchildren; now his are considerably older than mine. But it was not just two longtime friends catching up with each other. It was so clearly sharing what is most important to us, as it is to families everywhere in our country.
So I don't want the discussion about criminal justice, smart policing, to be siloed and to permit discussions and arguments and debates about it to only talk about that. The conversation needs to be much broader. Because that is a symptom, not a cause, of what ails us today.
The second area where we need to chart a new course is how we approach punishment and prison.
It's a stark fact that the United States has less than 5 percent of the world's population, yet we have almost 25 percent of the world's total prison population. The numbers today are much higher than they were 30, 40 years ago, despite the fact that crime is at historic lows.
Of the more than 2 million Americans incarcerated today, a significant percentage are low-level offenders: people held for violating parole or minor drug crimes, or who are simply awaiting trial in backlogged courts.
Keeping them behind bars does little to reduce crime. But it is does a lot to tear apart families and communities.
One in every 28 children now has a parent in prison. Think about what that means for those children.
When we talk about one and a half million missing African American men, we're talking about missing husbands, missing fathers, missing brothers.
They're not there to look after their children or bring home a paycheck. And the consequences are profound.
Without the mass incarceration that we currently practice, millions fewer people would be living in poverty.
And it's not just families trying to stay afloat with one parent behind bars. Of the 600,000 prisoners who reenter society each year, roughly 60 percent face long-term unemployment.
And for all this, taxpayers are paying about $80 billion a year to keep so many people in prison.
The price of incarcerating a single inmate is often more than $30,000 per year—and up to $60,000 in some states. That's the salary of a teacher or police officer.
One year in a New Jersey state prison costs $44,000—more than the annual tuition at Princeton.
If the United States brought our correctional expenditures back in line with where they were several decades ago, we'd save an estimated $28 billion a year. And I believe we would not be less safe. You can pay a lot of police officers and nurses and others with $28 billion to help us deal with the pipeline issues.
It's time to change our approach. It's time to end the era of mass incarceration. We need a true national debate about how to reduce our prison population while keeping our communities safe.
I don't know all the answers. That's why I'm here—to ask all the smart people in Columbia and New York to start thinking this through with me. I know we should work together to pursue together to pursue alternative punishments for low-level offenders. They do have to be in some way registered in the criminal justice system, but we don't want that to be a fast track to long-term criminal activity, we don't want to create another ""incarceration generation.""
I've been encouraged to see changes that I supported as Senator to reduce the unjust federal sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine crimes finally become law.
And last year, the Sentencing Commission reduced recommended prison terms for some drug crimes.
President Obama and former Attorney General Holder have led the way with important additional steps. And I am looking forward to our new Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, carrying this work forward.
There are other measures that I and so many others have championed to reform arbitrary mandatory minimum sentences are long overdue.
We also need probation and drug diversion programs to deal swiftly with violations, while allowing low-level offenders who stay clean and stay out of trouble to stay out of prison. I've seen the positive effects of specialized drug courts and juvenile programs work to the betterment of individuals and communities. And please, please, let us put mental health back at the top of our national agenda.
You and I know that the promise of de-institutionalizing those in mental health facilities was supposed to be followed by the creation of community-based treatment centers. Well, we got half of that equation—but not the other half. Our prisons and our jails are now our mental health institutions.
I have to tell you I was somewhat surprised in both Iowa and New Hampshire to be asked so many questions about mental health. ""What are we going to do with people who need help for substance abuse or mental illness?"" ""What are we going to do when the remaining facilities are being shut down for budget reasons?"" ""What are we going to do when hospitals don't really get reimbursed for providing the kind of emergency care that is needed for mental health patients?""
It's not just a problem in our cities. There's a quiet epidemic of substance abuse sweeping small-town and rural America as well. We have to do more and finally get serious about treatment.
I'll be talking about all of this in the months to come, offering new solutions to protect and strengthen our families and communities.
I know in a time when we're afflicted by short-termism, we're not looking over the horizon for the investments that we need to make in our fellow citizens, in our children. So I'm well aware that progress will not be easy, despite the emerging bipartisan consensus for certain reforms. And that we will have to overcome deep divisions and try to begin to replenish our depleted reservoirs of trust.
But I am convinced, as the congenital optimist I must be to live my life, that we can rise to this challenge. We can heal our wounds. We can restore balance to our justice system and respect in our communities. And we can make sure that we take actions that are going to make a difference in the lives of those who for too long have been marginalized and forgotten.
Let's protect the rights of all our people. Let's take on the broader inequities in our society. We can't separate out the unrest we see in the streets from the cycles of poverty and despair that hollow out those neighborhoods.
Despite all the progress we've made in this country lifting people up—and it has been extraordinary—too many of our fellow citizens are still left out.
Twenty-five years ago, in his inaugural address as Mayor, David Dinkins warned of leaving ""too many lost amidst the wealth and grandeur that surrounds us.""
Today, his words and the emotion behind them ring truer than ever. You don't have to look too far from this magnificent hall to find children still living in poverty or trapped in failing schools. Families who work hard but can't afford the rising prices in their neighborhood.
Mothers and fathers who fear for their sons' safety when they go off to school—or just to go buy a pack of Skittles.
These challenges are all woven together. And they all must be tackled together.
Our goal must truly be inclusive and lasting prosperity that's measured by how many families get ahead and stay ahead...
How many children climb out of poverty and stay out of prison...
How many young people can go to college without breaking the bank...
How many new immigrants can start small businesses ...
How many parents can get good jobs that allow them to balance the demands of work and family.
That's how we should measure prosperity. With all due respect, that is a far better measurement than the size of the bonuses handed out in downtown office buildings.
Now even in the most painful times like those we are seeing in Baltimore ...
When parents fear for their children...
When smoke fills the skies above our cities...
When police officers are assaulted...
Even then—especially then—let's remember the aspirations and values that unite us all: That every person should have the opportunity to succeed. That no one is disposable. That every life matters.
So yes, Mayor Dinkins. This is a time for wisdom.
A time for honesty about race and justice in America.
And, yes, a time for reform.
David Dinkins is a leader we can look to. We know what he stood for. Let us take the challenge and example he presents and think about what we must do to make sure that this country we love—this city we live in—are both good and great.
And please join me in saying a prayer for the family of Freddie Gray, and all the men whose names we know and those we don't who have lost their lives unnecessarily and tragically. And in particular today, include in that prayer the people of Baltimore and our beloved country.
Thank you all very much.

Hi, how are you? Well, it's wonderful to be back in Nevada and here at Rancho. I am delighted to be joined by a number of young people who are going to talk with me and all of you about their lives, their stories, and in particular immigration.
I want to acknowledge my friend and Congresswoman Dina Titus. Thank you so much for being here. And it is Cinco de Mayo, so that's especially appropriate day for us to be having this conversation.
I want to begin by thanking everyone at Rancho High School for hosting us today. I'm looking forward to hearing from each of our panel participants. I have a lot of wonderful memories from my time here in Nevada. I've gone door to door meeting with families not far from the school.
I've met with a lot of culinary workers and other workers who keep the economy going strong. I accompany the registered nurse on 12-hour shift at St. Rose Dominican Hospital and then was very pleased to go back to her home and have dinner with her and her kids.
And I know how hard hits Nevadans work by the great recession. This date in particular suffered some very tough blows. There were a much higher than average home for closure rate for example, a lot of people lost their jobs or their hours or cut dramatically which made it more difficult for them to continue to make a good living.
We now see that this state is coming back from those top economic times. Families have found a lot of different ways to make it work for them. We also saw people once again starting businesses, thinking about sending their kids to college. Maybe doing some home repairs, maybe putting a little bit aside for retirement. But we're not yet back on our feet.
We have certainly climbed out of the hole we were in, but now we've got to do more than just get by. We have to get ahead and stay ahead.
And there are a lot of ways that we have to think about how we do that together. I think that it's important to recognize that even with all of the hard work and sacrifices so many families made, in many ways, the deck is stacked in favor of those at the top. And I'm well aware that in Las Vegas there is nothing worse than a stacked deck.
I want to reshuffle the deck. I want to be a champion for hard-working Americans. I want to work across party lines. I want to work with the public and the private sector. I want people to get back to the good old-fashioned American style of problem solving and setting us on back the right course.
Now, to help reshuffle the deck, people have to do their part. They have to, you know, step up and take education seriously. They have to be willing to work hard because nothing is given to you. My dad was a small businessman and when I say that he was a really small businessman, you know, just a few day workers from time to time. My mom, my brothers and I, but he understood hard work was the path forward in the United States. He made a good living for our family and I will forever be grateful for that. Because when families are strong, America is strong. And I am convinced having thought for families going all the way back to my years in law school and ever since, there is nothing more important.
Now in this campaign, I think we have to wage and win four big fights. One is to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. And that means we've got to be really focused on what is going to prepare young people and we have to start early. Education is the key. But education in the first years of life is essential. Because now we know that brain development really has formed by the time a child is three or four. So, we've got to do more to make sure every child has the best chance to do well in school, to get ahead, to charge his or her own future, to live up to his or her own God-given potential.
It's also essential that we strengthen families and communities and that's means we have to finally once and for all fix our immigration system. This is a family issue. It's an economic issue, too.
But it is at heart a family issue at. And if we claim that we are for families, we have to pull together and resolve the outstanding issues around our broken immigration system. The American people support comprehensive immigration reform, not just because it's the right thing to do, and it is, but because they know it strengthens families, strengthens our economy, and strengthens our country. That's why we can't wait any longer. We can't wait any longer for a path to fall and equal citizenship.
Now this is where i differ with everybody on the republican side. Make no mistakes, today not a single republican candidate announced or potential is clearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship. Not one.
When they talk about legal status, that is code for second-class status. And we should never forget who this debate is about and you're going to meet some of them in just a minute. People who work hard, who love this country, who pay taxes to it and wants nothing more than to build a good future for themselves and their children.
We're talking about the young people at this table. They are dreamers in much more than name. They are kids that any parents or grandparent would be proud of. And I don't understand how anyone can look at these young people and think we should break up more families, or turn away more hard workers with talent to help us build the kind of country we all want to see.
So, I will fight for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship for you and for your family across our country. I will fight to stop partisan attacks on the executive actions that would put dreamers, including those with us today, at risk of deportation. And if Congress continues to refuse to act as president, I would do everything possible under the law to go even further.
There are more people, like many parents have dreamers, and others, with deep ties and contributions to our communities, who deserve a chance to stay and i will fight for them.
The law currently allows for sympathetic cases to be reviewed but right now most of these cases have no way to get a real hearing. Therefore, we should put in place a simple, straightforward, accessible way for parents of dreamers and others with a history of service and contribution to their communities, to make their case and to be eligible for the same deferred action as their children. But that's just the beginning. There's much more to do to expand and enhance protections for families and communities to reform immigration and enforcement and detention practices, so they are more humane, targeted, and effective. And to keep building the pressure and support for comprehensive reform.
You know, our personal basis, the first time I ever met anyone who was in our country working was when I was about 12 years old, as I recall. And through my church, I was recruited, along with some other girls in our Sunday school class to serve as babysitters on Saturday for the small children, so the older children could join their parents in the fields because believe it or not when I was growing up in the Chicago area, it was farm field as far as the eye could see. And the migrants, immigrant laborer would come up, through the Texas up through Midwest, up to Chicago, then up to Michigan. And we were asked to try to help out.
I remember going to the camp where the families lived and taking care of the little kids, while kids at my age were doing really hard work.
And what stuck in my mind was how at the end of the day there was a long road from in the camp that went out to a kind of dirt road in the middle of the fields. And the bus that had the workers from the field down it that came back around 4:00, 5:00 in the afternoon, stopped and let off the parents and the older brothers and sisters and all these little kids started running down the path to see their moms and dads and their big brothers and sisters. And they were scooped up by these really, really tired people.
And I just watched this and I thought, they're just like me and my brothers. You know, when my dad comes home from work, and we go out to see him. After he has come back from his day of doing what he had to do to help support us. I've never gotten that experience to the image out of my mind.
And so, for me, this is about what kind of people we are and what kind of country we have. And I am actually convinced this is in our economic interest. It's in the interest of our values and it's even in the interest of our long-term security as a nation. So, you know, where I stand. And there can be no question about it because I will do everything I can, as president, and during this campaign, to make this case.
I know there are people who disagree with me but I want them to have a conversation with me. Because the facts are really clear. You know, we know how much people who are working hard contribute to our economy, both in what they buy and what they pay in Texas. In fact in New York, which I know a little bit about because I representative for eight years and I lived there now, our undocumented workers in New York pay more in taxes than some of the biggest corporations in New York. So, I'm ready to have this discussion with anybody, anywhere, any time.
But let me turn to the people who are living this story. I want you to meet them. I want you to hear from them. And I'm going to start with you, Asther , if you will introduce yourself, and talk about your own life and what brings you to the table today.
SILVA: Thank you, secretary. My name is Asther Silva. I am currently a student at the Nevada State College pursuing my degree in history with thesis in pre-law. I arrived in United States when I was four years old. And Nevada has been my home since I was five. I came here with my mom and dad. I had a younger brother here. He is a United States citizen.
Fortunately, our family was scammed when I was very young. And because of that my father was given a deportation order. And so know, he's in order of deportation.
CLINTON: He was scammed because you hired a lawyer to help you?
SILVA: Yes. Well, it wasn't a lawyer. It was [inaudible] who took advantage of the fact that, you know, there was a lot of different immigration programs in the 1990s and people did not understand the differences. And so because of that, in 2001, my father was given deportation order that was not acted on until 2011. So our family in those 10 years did not know he been had that order deportation.
Right now, thankfully, because of prior to your discussion, my dad has state of removal so he will qualify for the different action program once the lawsuit that's really an obstacle right now is moved out of the way. And my mom will who is here, she will be able to apply so that we're not afraid that she will be deported.
CLINTON: And talk to me a little bit about what you have done in school. How you see your future. The contributions you have already made as a young person and what you would like to do further.
SILVA: Growing up, I was really dedicated to school. My parents, they put a really big emphasis on me succeeding because of all the sacrifices they had made. They had not seen their family in 25 years.
And so when I went to elementary school, middle school, I was really—I was dedicated. In seventh grade, I was named the gladiator of the year at my middle school because I was the student that showed—ironically the most citizenship. And so just programs like that, but I could not take advantage of them because when once I turned the age of going to college, I couldn't have a way out.
I was afraid for many years until finally a counselor at my college, at the college at College of Southern Nevada at that time knew what was happening and helped guide me and I became involved in politics. And knowing that I didn't have to be afraid from myself because there was something, and I met other people that we're in the same situation as myself, which is something that never happened before.
CLINTON: Erica—that his mom. Part of our jobs as mom is to embarrass our children at any possible moment, but also when we're proud of them to show that pride. So, I'm happy that they're there.
Erica, how did you end up here with us today?
ERICA: I'm here to basically share my story. I came to the United States when I was two years old. My parents and I made the journey here after we lost my little sister. They basically wanted to give me a better future. I now have a 17-year-old brother. He's a U.S. citizen. And now with my parents would qualify if the lawsuit was lifted.
I'm currently going to CFS. I want to major in political science and psychology. And I'm just here wondering what are your plans to help my community and help my family and help us not to live in fear anymore?
CLINTON: Yes. Now that's why I think it so important that we continue to try to change the laws comprehensively. But as I have said numerous times, I support the president's action in the face of in action.
I was personally very disappointed that when I was a senator for eight years, we had a few chances to try to do more for dreamers, do more for comprehensive immigration reform, and we were not successful.
And then when I was Secretary of State, I was very pleased that there was bipartisan agreement in the Senate for comprehensive immigration reform. And it was such a good signal that Democrats and Republicans can work together, could solve a difficult problem, could put aside partisan differences. And the Senate passed it and the House of Representatives would never take it up.
And I think it would have passed if they had taken it up. But I think that they—the leadership in the House decided that politically they didn't want to do that because they had people who were strongly opposed to comprehensive immigration reform.
But I think we have to keep working on it. And that is why your stories are so important because we can't look at it as though it is some kind of abstraction. It's real people's lives and so many people who have made contributions, who have worked hard in school, who have started businesses, who have raised their children here.
And as you point out in your family, you have a brother who is a U.S. citizen. So it's—we have a lot of these blended families and I want to do more to make sure that Doca and Dapa and all of the changes that have occurred continue and even expand. I would like to try to do more on behalf of the parents of dreamers who are not necessarily included. But the best way is to get the comprehensive immigration reform in our Congress and try to resolve all of this.
UNKNOWN: I'm 26 years. And I have been here since I was one year old. I graduated this summer with a degree in psychology and criminal justice. And unfortunately, when I was 15 years old, both my parents and I we received orders for deportation. And since that day we have lived in fear.
Thankfully, because of the production I have some relief, but unfortunately, I can't do the same thing from my parents. Unless the lawsuit again, stop or is dropped, my parents' future isn't secure here in United States. And as a current documented immigrant here in the United States, I stand for me with the 50,000 undocumented transgender immigrants in this country who lack resources to get any legal representation to file within the one-year Deadline for asylum.
So my question, Secretary Clinton, is would you lift the one-year deadline for asylum-seekers?
CLINTON: Well, I think there's several things about that question that I'd like to answer of. One is I think that people in the immigration system should be represented. And we have made some progress on that, but not enough. And so I am in favor, particularly for young people, to have representation.
I'd like everyone to have it. But if we have to, you know, try to prioritize, I would like young people, I would like people from vulnerable populations, who would otherwise not have the support that they need. And I don't think there's anything magic about the one-year. I think that as part of comprehensive reform, we need to look at how we make our entire system more humane.
I also—I'm very worried about detention and detention facilities for people who are vulnerable, and four children, that I think we could do a better job if we kept detention to people who have a record of violence, illegal behavior and that we have a different approach toward people who are not in that category. And I don't think we should put, you know, children and vulnerable people into big detention facilities because I think they are at risk. I think that their physical and mental health are at risk.
So, these are issues that we should go as far as we can to get the resources to provide support and particularly representation and change some of our detention processes within the kind of discretion that I think the president has exercised with his executive orders. But it's also clear as the president has said many times a lot of these issues can only be resolved once and for all if we have changes in the law.
So, I want to protect people. I want more humane treatment. No matter how the law currently is written or how it's enforced. And to put the resources behind doing that and then continue to fight for comprehensive reform. Thank you. Wanda
UNKNOWN: Thank you, Secretary Clinton for being here and hearing our story and welcome to Nevada.
CLINTON: Thank you.
UNKNOWN: I arrived to the United States when I was seven months old. Nevada is the only place I call home. And I grew up here. I went to school here. I graduate in University of Nevada [inaudible] with two degrees here, education as you've mentioned earlier is one of our strong points as dreamers.
And because of it, I'm looking at pursuing a law degree. But, again, the system of immigration messes up my family. [inaudible] in our family.
I come from a mixed status family. Meaning my sister is a U.S. citizen who petitioned from my father to change the legal status, and he became a legal permanent resident. When we planned to do the same for my mother, unfortunately, she faces the three tenure bar. Because of it, it was either make the decision to have her either separate our family or keep our family together. And a strong message in the immigration community is keeping our families together, and that is the path what we took.
CLINTON: Right.
UNKNOWN: Unfortunately, she continues to be undocumented. I have—and what the president executive action, she will qualify for [inaudible], thankfully, but unfortunately with the lawsuit we—it's another obstacle in the way.
CLINTON: Wanda could you explain for people who might not know what the three and 10 rule is because it causes a lot of these issues.
UNKNOWN: Of course. For example, my mother and I, we entered—the term—legal term enter by infection but we use the term the illegally. My father in his case entered with a work permit. So, he entered legally. And because of it, we faced a 3 to 10 year bar because we way we entered to our journey. We took a different way compared to my father.
So because of it, we face 3-10 year bar, we would have to leave our country. We tried to do it the right way undocumented community. But we had to leave the country for 3 to 10 years as a pardon for entering illegally into the country.
CLINTON: Well, I think your example illustrates the difficulties of these rules that are applied to everybody under every circumstance without looking at the underlying situation. And you have a sister who is a citizen. You have a father who is now a legal permanent resident. You came here at seven months and you have done extremely well with your education, and you're obviously a very committed young person. And your mother, who kept the family going as moms do would have to leave for the 3 to 10-year period in order to be able to petition for reentry and therefore be determined as legal.
That's why I have promoted, ever since, you know, we've been having this debate, going back to when I was in the senate, a comprehensive immigration reform program, similar to what the Senate passed on a bipartisan basis, where the people who have been here and people who have as your family has, you know, contributed and worked hard, you would have, you know, pay a fine. You'd probably, you know, we'd want you to learn English which is not a problem before anybody around this table. And we would, you know, want you to, you know, get in line to get a path to citizenship but you'd be no longer at risk of being deported and you would not have to leave the country for 3 to 10 years in order to be able to try to come back in.
So, I think there are—there's agreement among the people who supported the bipartisan bill in the Senate even though—I guess some of them are paying a political price for it right now, nevertheless, it was the right thing that they may get it, it is still the right thing.
Because we have gained so much from people who—like your families have come here and work hard and made a contribution. So, thank you for explaining that and it shows how difficult it is in so many families to be able to figure out what to do.
And Juan, you have an interesting story because you are a one of those small businessmen. You know, I said the other day I wan to be the president for small business because that's where most jobs created and that's where I think the real engine of economic recovery and growth comes from. So, why don't you tell us what you've been doing?
UNKNOWN: My name is Juan Salazar. I'm 22 years old. I came here when I was seven when I was young. I grew up here. This is all I know, the place I called home. And I'm undocumented. I struggled when I get—it hit me when I got out of high school. It was hard to find a job.
In high school, I found my friends were getting these jobs or getting their drivers license becoming more independent. You know, I got left behind.
But—fortunately, thanks to DACA, I was able to get a work permit and I'll tell you—and I could tell us pick from all of us undocumented or immigrant. I did not take no opportunity for granted. We don't take an opportunities for granted and I feel like we don't get those a lot. And right away I went to go get my business license and—to—I have my own pool cleaning service. So my own company and me and my [inaudible]. And we started off with three pools. And I got my business license. I went to get certified. And, you know, to promote my name and everything.
And you know, two or three years later, now, we have over 50 pools. And, you know, I am growing as to [inaudible]. I make sure that I work hard because when we didn't have anything, when my dad lost his job, when the decision hit, we lost our house. We didn't have work. We had to sell food to pay the phone bills. And, you know, I was the only going way up from there.
And we're working hard every day. And, you know, I'm only learning through the struggles that we've been through, and taking it step-by-step.
CLINTON: I'm very proud to hear your story. Of course, I mean, let's face it, you can clean pools all year round in Nevada. We have a shorter season where I live. But the fact that, you know, you and your dad really were determined to recover from losing your home, losing his job, and just doing what you had to do to be as successful as possible, is the American story.
I mean that is what is so moving to me about what happened to you.
UNKNOWN: Yes. And, you know, I felt—at least [inaudible] for once I got the [inaudible]. I got my work's permit, but I cannot say the same thing for my parents because they don't qualify for that type of—because, you know, we are all undocumented. So it was just, you know, I'm happy for the ones who were able to. But now they have a speed bump because...
CLINTON: Right.
UNKNOWN: ... they've got to slow down now. And I just want to make sure my parents are protected [inaudible] any minute. And I would not wish that on anybody.
CLINTON: Right.
UNKNOWN: Our family separated that far. So, you know, right here in Nevada, 21 percent of the business are owned by immigrants. So we are making a lot of—we are moving up here and we're making a difference. All we want is work and, you know, provide for our families. And we're very united—me and my family. So...
CLINTON: That's great. Well, I think that you put an important statistic, which is nationally, not just in Nevada, so many of the new small businesses are started by immigrants. And that's something we should be celebrating, not trying to prevent or breakup, because of status differences.
And also on the fact that you're so worried about your parents. I mean I will certainly try to do everything I can to, you know, avoid family breakup, avoid the kind of terrible experience that too many families have already gone through, because they were split up. And half of their family, or the breadwinner in their family, you know, picked up and gone one day.
So that's just—it's not smart and it's not right. Do you want to share your story?
UNKNOWN: My name is [inaudible]. I am 16 years old. I'm a junior and went to high school. It's either medical minor program. I arrived in this country at the age of two. And since then, I thank the dedication of my parents. I have been able to succeed in school. I have...
CLINTON: Yes.
UNKNOWN: Currently, as a junior, I continue and start to look towards my future. But once I began to look at what I have in my future, there is not a lot open. I mean, yes, think that guy could go to school, but afterwards, what is there for me? Like, I want to be a doctor. I want to go to Yale.
CLINTON: OK.
UNKNOWN: But, after Yale, I can't really become a doctor since my lack of [inaudible]
CLINTON: well, I think should brag on you. You may be a junior but you have the highest grade point average in the whole class, right? And I think one of your counselors told me it was 4.8. I didn't even know they went that high.
So you are exactly the kind of student that every family—that every community should be proud of. And the idea that you want to be a doctor is something we should be encouraging and trying to clear the path so you can go on and do that. Tell me about your family. What happened with the rest of your family?
UNKNOWN: My—both of my parents also arrived as undocumented.
CLINTON: OK.
UNKNOWN: So I —and they were both depending on DACA. My specifically, he bright future to open up his own mechanic shop which he could be currently a mechanic. And with that, he would be able to expand his business. However, since the delay he really can't.
CLINTON: Well, I think it's important to, you know, put faces behind the stories. Several of you have mentioned how the lawsuit tried to prevent the implementation of President Obama's executive order has really stopped the plan—stopped plans for new businesses, stopped plans for going to school, or what you're going to do when you graduate just creating more uncertainty.
And that is what you are describing with respect to your father. Yes. You know, I think that certainty is really important, predictability, regularization, if you will. People need to know what's going to happen. And it is just unrealistic, and I think, foolish to continue to talk as though we're going to deport 11 million or 12 million people. That is not going to happen.
And so, when you accept the fact that is not going to happen...
UNKNOWN: No.
CLINTON: ... right? I once calculated when I was in the Senate how much money it would cost, how many buses would be required. I mean it's just, you know, it's beyond absurd. That's not going to happen. So then, what we have to do is accept the fact we are a nation of immigrants. It always have been. I think it was Franklin Roosevelt who might have said that we started off as a nation of revolutionaries and immigrants. And that has continued throughout our history.
So we have to solve the issues that are around this situation that we are faced with. And the facts are really clear about the contributions, the economic consumer contributions, the paying of taxes contributions, and then the young people who work hard and are looking for a place in society.
So I know that you each have had very personal experiences. And now is your chance to maybe say what you think should be done and how it should be done so that we have, you know, a debate that is about the realities, not about, you know, the talking points and the arguments. Esther , would you like to start?
UNKNOWN: Well, secretary, I think one of the most important things for us is family unification. As you mentioned, 11 million people could not be deported. However, millions have already been deported.
We have here with us Victoria. She's also a dreamer who received DACA. She hasn't seen her mother in four years because they had to go back to Mexico for an emergency. And on the way back, her mother was unfortunately—broke her leg on the journey back to the United States. And Victoria came here alone. So she's been with a guardian for the past four years.
And to me, one of the questions is what will happen to those families who've already been separated? Thankfully, I go to bed every night and, you know, I live in the fear that my parents will be deported, but they're still here.
CLINTON: Right.
UNKNOWN: I can talk to them and I can see them. You know, and I think all of our stories have very complex issues where Juan working and his family's also makes status family all tired of it. You know, we all have siblings which two to three to 10 year bar. Our parents would qualify for adjustment. Unfortunately, that's still in place.
So my question is a little bit expanding on several of those issues.
CLINTON: Yes. No, I think that reunification should be one of our goals in Comprehensive Immigration Reform because, you know, we have attempted to deal with this challenge for years now and in the absence of actually finally passing Comprehensive Immigration Reform, a lot of families have been broken up.
And that's just really so painful for people who live through it, but even for those of us on the outside looking at it to even imagine what that must be like. And that's why I want to do everything we can to defend the president's executive orders because I think they were certainly within his authority. Constitutionally, legally, they were based on precedent that I believe is adequate. And then, still try to go further and deal with some of these other issues, like the reunification of families that were here and that have been split up since the last eight, 10, 12 years. Yes.
UNKNOWN: For me, if there's 276,000 undocumented LGBT immigrants here in the United States, around 15 to 50 of them are trans. So as a lesbian woman, I'd like to know how we can protect our trans brothers and sisters from being put into institutions where they don't identify with their gender identity?
CLINTON: Well, that's what Rafael was also referring to earlier. And look I think that we have to do more to provide safe environments for vulnerable populations. And that certainly includes the LGBT community, also includes children, and it includes unaccompanied children. There are just a—there are groups of people who I think we deserve a higher level of care, because of the situations that they are finding themselves in.
I also think that we have to reform our detention system. I've, you know, I'm not sure a lot of Americans know that a lot of the detention facilities for immigrants are run by private companies and that they have a built in incentive to fill them up, that there is actually a legal requirement that so many beds be filled. So people go out and round up people in order to get paid on a per bed basis. I mean that just makes no sense at all to me. I mean that's not the way we should be running any detention facility.
So I think there is a lot we have to do to change what is currently happening and to try to put us on a path toward a better, fairer, or more humane system for everybody. Yes.
UNKNOWN: I think our court ability is a major factor. Many undocumented immigrants have been exploited. Personally, my parents were actually exploited. When they were at—to this country, they had to work for $2 an hour. That was actually in 1990.
I also think that since many of these—many of our parents have actually, you know, had a work in a little wage jobs in order to, you know, to move up. I think it's also important to raise the minimum wage throughout the country and—because I think people deserve to make a living wage.
CLINTON: Yes. No, I agree with that completely. I am very much in favor of raising the minimum wage at the federal level. States and some cities are on their own raising the minimum wage. But I think there needs to be a federal floor. And I believe that the Democrats in the Senate are going to introduce legislation to do just that in the week. So I agree with you. Blanca ?
UNKNOWN: Secretary Clinton, I think the biggest thing is, as you mentioned, you were going to keep the executive—if elected president, you plan to keep the executive order. But as a down, you mentioned as well that you are going to push Congress. We look forward—well, personally, and I think all of us at this table look forward to a day where we all become citizens of this country. All of us at the table have knocked doors, phoned banks to get voters out there. And we tell them our stories, because it's so important that they're vote not—it's not only voting for themselves, they are voting for us and the future of this country.
CLINTON: Right.
UNKNOWN: So if and when elected, do you plan to push Congress as your first initiative, to push for a Comprehensive Immigration Reform?
CLINTON: Well, it certainly be among my first initiatives. I can't—sitting here today—predict what will be happening. I know that happened to President Obama when he was elected and found out that we were falling into an economic abyss. And I think he deserves a lot of credit for restabilizing our situation and getting us back on the economic upswing.
So but among the priorities that I would be advocating for—in the beginning would be Comprehensive Immigration Reform. And one of the reasons for that, in addition to everything we've discussed is as secretary of state, I saw what happens to countries that established a second-class status for people.
They do not feel that they belong, or they have any allegiance to the country in which they live and work because they're never fully accepted. That is a recipe for divisiveness and even for disintegration. And there fore, my view strongly is that we are a nation of immigrants. We have assimilated tens and tens of millions of people over the course of our history.
UNKNOWN: Yes.
CLINTON: We have 11 million, 12 million people right now who are undocumented. The vast majority of whom have proven that they want to be a citizen of this country and we should put them on that path. And those who say, ""Yes, we can do reform, but not a path to citizenship,"" would be fundamentally undermining what has made America unique—the way we have assimilated people, the way people who come here feel so loyal, the contributions they make.
So this is not just in my view the right thing to do for America. If you compare us to other countries that did not take that step, you can see what it's done to them. And I don't want to go there. So I very firmly support a path to citizenship in the context of Comprehensive Immigration Reform. Juan?
UNKNOWN: I kind of just want to add a little personal story with what Rafael said. When I graduated high school, I realized I couldn't find any work. And my dad wasn't working as well. And we found a landscaping job, like a labor for a company. And we're actually getting paid $6 an hour where they would work us like excessively.
And, you know, I was young. And I was just working really, really hard. It's been to a point where you felt like that you'd be humiliated. I remember we'd been working and that the boss was there. We could not look at him in the eye. We could not look at him, and we could not stop working. We hadn't worked harder. And even if it was lunchtime, you had to be working until he left.
And, you know, I was just—there's lots of stories not just like that. There's other stories that we have and I'm through that. It just felt like that and it's really hard. And, you know, me and my dad worked really hard. You know, Timber United —so when he would get home from work, and I would see him limping, I don't like, you know, I don't want this for him which is kind of what motivated me to do something for us.
CLINTON: Right.
UNKNOWN: And, you know, he's helped me out through all his life and raised me to respect everyone and be honest and, you know, supported me with school. When we didn't have money, I'd still go part-time to see a cent. I don't know how I did it but I was going. And, you know, I just looking out for him. And we can't [inaudible] united so I'm really glad he's like my business partner.
CLINTON: I bet he'd say the same thing about you.
UNKNOWN: Yes.
CLINTON: But, you know, Juan, you make a good point. It's not only about the minimum wage and decent working conditions for people like you and your dad. Often times when I have conversations with people who are fearful about immigration reform, their fears are rooted in the feeling that they're losing jobs that are going to people who are undocumented.
And part of that fear has a reality to it is because if people pay you $6 hour, because you're undocumented. Why would they pay somebody who already is a citizen what the minimum wage should be? So my argument is the quicker we can legalize the people who are here, the better the job market will be for everybody because you will not have a group of people who are taken advantage of and you will not have others who feel as though—and to some extent it's true—are losing jobs because this group that is being taken advantage of is paid so much less and treated so much worse.
So my argument to people who worry about Comprehensive Immigration Reform and the effect on their jobs, it's just the opposite. The sooner we can get to legalization, the better the job market will be for everybody. Then, employers will not be able to violate the laws—the Wage and Hour Laws for example, because they're not dealing with a workforce that is scared to say anything, or even scared to look at the boss when he shows up on the work site.
So this is about everybody, not just about you and your dad.
UNKNOWN: Yes, of course.
CLINTON: Yes.
UNKNOWN: I'll tell you one more question.
CLINTON: OK.
UNKNOWN: I just wanted to say, what do you plan—well, I know here in Nevada and this county our education—we keep on like lowering the education. A lot of kids aren't graduating. And I feel like we need to reach out to these kids and...
CLINTON: Right.
UNKNOWN: ... show them that school is very important and so is higher education. A lot of kids don't even—they qualify for college—there's not an—maybe we need to figure out some other way. I think a lot of the reason is because of funding.
CLINTON: Yes.
UNKNOWN: They can't afford it and they feel discouraged and they just go on...
CLINTON: Right.
UNKNOWN: ... and decide not to go to school.
CLINTON: Right. Well, look I think that that's a big part of what we have to do to make sure that out economy is competitive and also to make sure that every young person has a chance to continue their education whether it's a community college or college or a job training kind of program that will give them a good start. And you make a really strong point because it's so expensive to continue your education that too many kids are feeling—and their parents are feeling it's just beyond their reach.
So that's why I support President Obama's proposal for free community college which at least get you started and I'd like to look to see how we get the debt under control and give people a chance to, you know, not be burdened by debt which makes it really hard for them to start a business or to continue their education.
So this is going to be a big part of, you know, my education policy as I go forward in the campaign because you're 100 percent right. Too many young people today feel like, you know, it's just out of their reach or they graduate with some much debt they feel like they are paralyzed. They don't know what to do. They can't buy a house, they can't get married, they can't start a business because the have so much in student debt.
And, you know, then, in Iowa and in New Hampshire, you know, the average student in Iowa graduates with about $30,000 worth of debt, and then, the average student in New Hampshire, about $32,000 worth of debt. They're at the higher end. Nevada is still at the lower end of debt.
But, you know, you also have a lot of people who don't have that much in assets and income. So it's all, you know, relative to what they can afford. So we have to do more on that. And I want to put in a big plug before we give you the last word about Rancho because I learned today that this school uses Title I funds to pay for the A.P. exam fee. This is, you know, this sounds a little archane but I want to emphasize how important this is because when you look at high school education, making it possible for more students to have access to advanced placement courses really ups the level of education.
It gives kids a leg up if they go on to college because they may have some credit before they ever get there. But too many kids in the past and still across our country don't take the test because—I don't know what it does today—$80?
UNKNOWN: $85.
CLINTON: $85. That's a lot of money if, you know, you're making minimum wage or less. So I want to—I really want to—I don't—I hope that the Rancho administrators are still here because—good. The principal is still here. I want to give them a big shout out for using Title I funding to make sure every kid who wants to take an A.P. course gets to and gets to take the exam.
So I'm sure, you're going to do some of that next year. [crosstalk] Currently. You have them tomorrow?
UNKNOWN: I had my Chemistry test Monday and I have my Statistics and English Language next Monday.
CLINTON: So you're taking three A.P. exams as a junior?
UNKNOWN: Yes.
CLINTON: Wow. Wow. OK.
UNKNOWN: [inaudible] to education topic?
CLINTON: Sure.
UNKNOWN: Once DACA was brought open—established, it opened doors for many like myself to school to try Yale, Harvard, et cetera. But oftentimes, the journey ends there and I was wondering if or what was your position or what will you offer in order for us to be able to continue on to our education and become or raised doctors, so on and so forth.
CLINTON: Well, I think it's very shortsighted of us not to legalize students who graduate from college and can use their skills to make a good life for themselves but also to give back. We have thousands and thousands of foreign students come to our country every year. And they get a great education in our colleges and universities. And then, a lot of them stay.
Well, I want you to be a doctor if that's what you want to be. I mean you've come up to our system, you've worked hard, and then you've done exceptionally well. So I think this is the particular fix in addition to the other fixes we've been talking about.
You know, I read an article recently about a group of young, undocumented men who were really interested in technology and they entered a contest against kids from the best schools and companies and they won. And so, you have four kids who beat the best of the best. And they couldn't do anything because they were undocumented.
And I am sitting there thinking, ""What is wrong with this picture?"" We are in a global competition and I intend for us to win it. And I'm about to let anybody who can make a contribution to our economy and our society get thrown away.
So from my perspective we need to fix that, we need to remove the fear, and we need to make sure that we give every child a chance to do the best that he or she can. And if that means going to Yale and becoming a doctor I want that to happen.
So, as you can tell, I could be here all day because, you know, six exceptional young people, we have some proud parents and grandparents and teachers here.
But let me and where I started thanking Rancho for having me here, thanking each of you for being willing and brave enough to sit here and talk about your own lives. I want to reiterate my strong support for the president's executive actions because he had to act in the face of inaction that was not on the merits but politically motivated for partisan reasons which I think is not the way we should be solving our problems in our country, in our Congress or anywhere else.
And I'm so pleased that the congresswoman is here because I know she's a champion for a lot of the issues that we are talking about today. And I want to get back to good old-fashioned problem-solving. And this is one of the problems we have to solve together.
So I pledge to you I will do everything I possibly can to make this an issue in the campaign but more importantly, when I'm president, to put it on the top of my priority list.
So if you'll stay here, we're going to do a picture. And maybe we could get the Rancho—the principal and others to come up and join us, you know. Yes. Let's get the administrators who invited us all here to come and stand. If you'll just stand with us we will get a picture with everybody. Congresswoman, why don't you join us?
[crosstalk]
Write me a memo about what I need to do differently. Yes, you want to come around?
UNKNOWN: What if everybody stand up?
CLINTON: OK. We stand up? That's good. Excellent.
UNKNOWN: OK.
Come closer.
CLINTON: OK. Come closer. Give me that. And Juan, you're going to give me that. That's great.
[crosstalk]
UNKNOWN: Say cheese.
CLINTON: Yes, look at Barb and then we'll look at all the very proud parents with their cameras.
UNKNOWN: OK.
CLINTON: OK. So we'll look over here. OK, got some cameras over here. It's like when you're on the red carpet and they yell at you. ""Look here"".
OK. Thank you. Great. You want to come around? OK. Good to meet you, Chris.
UNKNOWN: Good to meet you. Thank you so much.
CLINTON: I'm so happy I could. Thank you so much.
UNKNOWN: I'm very grateful.
CLINTON: Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Is your name Barbara ?
UNKNOWN: Barb.
Everyone call her Barb.
CLINTON: Barb.
UNKNOWN: Thank you.
And just so you know, my mom write to you like everywhere. [inaudible] friendly.
CLINTON: Good.
UNKNOWN: [inaudible] go away and you should call it Hillary until [inaudible] Hillary is...
CLINTON: I love that.
UNKNOWN: Right. It's nice.
CLINTON: Here you go.

Wow. Thank you. I am thrilled to be here with all of you.
And Sarah, that was excellent. I thank you so much.
And I hope you'll get to know Sarah and spend time with her and help her as she works so hard between now and February 1st.
And Dean and Gary, thank you for welcoming us to your beautiful home; what a delight it is to be here with you. [applause]
Somebody asked me the other day, well, you know, you're going to these events, where you're taking time to actually talk and listen to people, is that really what you're going to do?
And I said, well, yes, it is because not only do I learn a lot but I also feel like it's the best way to make those connections that will not only give me a firm foundation in the caucus here in Iowa or in a primary in New Hampshire—because it really is about people-to-people connections if we're really talking about what we want to do—but it will also give me the kind of information I need to be an even better president.
And I just had another example about that. You may know that Gary's a radiologist and right before we came in, we were talking about his work. He's an expert in breast cancer. And I asked him about the mammography recommendations that's at least the women in the room I'm sure have seen over the last several years.
And he was giving me some really important insight into the commission that made those recommendations and his expert opinion about them. And I'm so grateful to you for that because it's the kind of discussion that you can't have unless you have an opportunity to actually talk and listen with people.
I want to thank all of you for coming. I am delighted to have this chance to talk with you. I think what we're going to do is I'll say a few words about the campaign and what I want to achieve. And then we'll have a chance to talk individually and I'll be able to hear from each and every one of you.
I have been incredibly impressed over the last several years at how hard the American people have worked to pull ourselves out of the Great Recession. People have made a lot of sacrifice. People have lost jobs. They lost houses. They lost the chance to finish or go on with their education. And they did everything that they could think of to do to get back on their feet.
And I'm so relieved that, as I travel around the country and talk with people, there is a sense that we are on our feet. We're not running yet but we are on our feet. And we can see the changes that are happening in people's lives and put them in a context as to where we go from here now as a country.
I'm very grateful to President Obama for the hard decisions he made when he inherited the mess that he inherited when he became president in 2009. [applause]
And I know that he and I and everyone who was in his administration realizes that, unless the American family and the American worker is strong, everything we want to see happen for our country is going to be much more difficult. And so I come to this campaign committed to being a champion for Americans and American families.
That's what my work has been throughout my entire adult life, starting with my first job out of law school when I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, all the way through to the work that I did as secretary of state promoting women's rights, promoting the rights of people who would otherwise be marginalized or left on the sidelines.
And I know that, although we have to—it's still hard to imagine exactly how we're going to get to the point where people are not just getting by but getting ahead again and staying ahead because, look, the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. We know that.
And so we have to be especially focused on how we're going to bring about the changes that will ignite opportunity for everybody willing to work hard for it again.
So when I look at where we are as a nation and where we need to be, I see four big challenges that we have to take on together. And there are going to be fights, because they're—if they were easy, they would already be done. So I will posit that right now.
Number one, we have to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. It needs to be innovative. It needs to be sustainable. It needs to be producing good jobs with rising wages. We need to get back into the habit of actually rewarding workers with increases in their paychecks for the increases in productivity and profitability that they have helped to bring about. [applause]
You know, Warren Buffett has said it, but so have a lot of other people. There's something wrong when the average American CEO makes 300 times more than the typical American worker or when hedge fund managers themselves make more and pay less in taxes than nurses and truck drivers.
In fact, I heard a statistic the other day that really made a big impact on me, that the top 25 hedge fund managers together made more money than all the kindergarten teachers in America.
And when you think about value, what it is that's going to get us moving again, I think kindergarten teachers are really important. And so—[laughter and applause]—and we've got to make a claim on becoming the 21st century clean energy superpower. Iowa has really helped us. The RFS, the renewable fuel standard and a lot of the investments that have made here, has been one of the reasons why we have made some real progress but not near enough. And other countries are going to seize that title unless we do what we have to.
It's also imperative that we give people the tools through education and job training and skills not just in rhetoric but in reality so that they can make the most out of their own lives. And for me that starts at the very beginning.
I have been a child advocate and a child development proponent for my entire adult life because it's what I really care about, what I believe in. And I think we have to start before kindergarten. We have to have universal pre-K but we also have to do more to reach out to families so they know the tools they should use to be their children's first teachers.
Now we've got this new granddaughter who is unbelievable. And we were with her this weekend. You know, we go and just stare at her. I mean, that's what—it's really—it's wonderful and silly at the same time.
But we also read to her. Here she is, 7.5 months old, we're reading and reading and reading. And I imagine among her first words were—will be, you know, ""Enough with the reading,"" because between her mom and her dad and Bill and I, we're constantly doing that.
But we're doing it not only because we love to do it and we love to see her begin to reach her hands out and grab onto the books, we're doing it because we know that it aids her brain development. That has been one of the great discoveries with brain research in the last couple of decades.
We increasingly can see what happens when you are literally feeding the brain as well as the body of these infants and then the babies and the toddlers. That will help them be better prepared when they actually end up in kindergarten and it will begin to close the achievement gap because, you know, we're going to do everything we can for our granddaughter. Charlotte will get every opportunity we can possibly imagine.
But what kind of country will she grow up in?
And what kind of world will she enter?
And what will happen to all of the other infants, babies, toddlers and children in our country today?
So we have to look at education from the very beginning. Then we have to make sure that we are doing all we can to empower our teachers, to make sure that they have the support of parents so that they can do the job they have been trained to do to help prepare our kids.
And then we've got to make sure that college is affordable. And that cannot happen at the rate we're going unless we change the way we fund college education for young people who wish to have that experience.
Many of us in this room, I bet, as I did, borrowed money to go to college. But then we were able to pay it back because it wasn't such an overwhelming burden as it has become now.
The average student in Iowa graduates with $30,000 in debt and that then makes it very difficult for them to start a business or buy a new home or even get married, as one young man told me not so long ago.
So we have to deal with the indebtedness to try to move toward making college as debt-free as possible. I'm 100 percent behind President Obama's proposal for free community college. We've got to try to get that through.
And then we've got to try to do everything we can to make college available and affordable to all of our young people. [applause]
You know, when you think about our economy today, it is absolutely linked to education. It is also linked to strong families and strong communities. And that's our second challenge, because a lot of families and communities have been under tremendous strain.
One of the biggest stresses in anybody's life is health care. I will fight to protect the Affordable Care Act and I will work to make the changes that are required. [applause]
We are really now in a different world, 16 million people who didn't have health insurance who now do. We have to do everything we can to make sure that Medicare is as available and protected and affordable as possible. And we have to be sure that where there are changes that can be made we try to find ways to work across the aisle to make them.
I don't hear my friends on the other side of the aisle talking as much as they used to about getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. I think the reason is is because there are a lot of people that they may actually be encountering from time to time who have been helped. And we need to make sure to make the argument over and over again, what will you do if you say to people we're going to take away the health care we finally have been able to provide for you? That is just unacceptable.
But there are some problems. You know, one of the problems—and I heard about this in Iowa—is what happens when a 26-year old becomes a 27-year old and is no longer eligible to be on his or her parents' policy? That was one of the best changes in the Affordable Care Act. And the fact is that a lot of young people aren't making the income they need yet to be able to afford their own health care. So we have to look out to see what we're going to be able to do to help them.
There are two issues that fall into this category that are huge strains on families. And I heard about them first—I heard first in Davenport and I heard about it all the way across the state until I got to Council Bluffs. One is the drug epidemic—meth, pills in Iowa and then I got to New Hampshire.
And at my very first coffee shop meeting I heard about the heroin epidemic in New Hampshire. In the past year I've been told reliably we had more people die of drug overdoses in America than automobile accidents for the first time in our history.
This is tearing families apart but it is below the surface. People aren't talking about it because it's something that is hard to deal with.
I also heard a lot about untreated mental health problems. And so many communities, so many states turning their backs on people with mental health problems. Facilities are being closed. Even though we now require there to be treatment in the Affordable Care Act, there's not enough available treatment. Not enough resources.
The other day, I was in California at an event. And I just said what I said. I said, you know, mental health is not being treated. We claim we're now going to be able to help people with their health care problems, but if we don't help with mental health, we're leaving out a huge number of people. And a young woman came up to me and asked me a question. She said, ""Did you know that we're having all these suicides in my high school?"" I said, ""No, I did not know that before I came."" She goes, ""Well, we've had four young people kill themselves in the last months.""
Then I was in New York at an event this past way. Said the same thing that I said to you, and then I was visiting with people. And a woman come up—came up to me and she goes, ""Thank you for mentioning mental health. We have gone in the last six months to four funerals of friends of my children who have killed themselves.""
I have to tell you, when I started running, when I started thinking about this campaign, I did not believe I would be standing in your living room talking about the drug abuse problem, the mental health problem and the suicide problem. But I am now convinced I have to talk about it. I have to do everything I can in this campaign to raise it... [applause] ...to end the stigma against talking about it.
And we also have a challenge that affects everything we do, and that is to fix our dysfunctional political system. And that—that underlies everything that we can possibly hope to get done. I'm very committed to meeting with anybody, going to have any conversation, to try to find common ground. But we also have to stand our ground. And we have to try to figure out how we're going to get people to work with us for the betterment of our country, the betterment of people who need a good positive support system, whether it be health care of aid for college, or anything else.
We also have to address the unaccountable dark money in politics. I think the supreme court made a grave error with its Citizens United decision. And I will do everything I can do to appoint supreme court justices who will protect the right to vote, and not the right of billionaires to buy elections. [applause]
And, you know, I've been consulting with a lot of legal experts. and some of them think there may be a way to get legislation through that will enable us to regulate this kind of use of money in our political system which is so corruptive and corrosive. But others agree with former Justice John Paul Stevens, who recently wrote a book in which he said it's going to take a constitutional amendment. I will work for that if that's the only way to fix this problem, because we cannot continue with the kind of assault on our democracy, on voting rights, and on the opportunity for us to know where the money is coming from that influences our political system.
Now, for us , we have challenges around the world. I was coming through the—the garage, there's a TV that Dean and Gary have, and it was talking about ISIS in Iraq. We have threats that we know of. That we can begin to try to figure out how best to address. It's not just dictators. Also disease, climate change, which—I think global warming is a threat to us. But we have to be confident and strong in understanding that there are many ways to approach the problems that America will be confronting in the world. And we must do so in cooperation with our friends, our allies, our fellow democracies around the world.
I am convinced that the 21st century can once again be a century in which the United States leads and helps to set the values and the standards. But we have to have an agreement, first of all, foremost, with our own country and in our own Congress about how to do that. I was outraged, and said at the time, that when a group of Republican senators sent a letter to the ayatollah of Iran, in a—essentially criticizing the actions of the president of the United States—I don't care what party you are. We have one president, and we should stand behind that president when he's trying to work out very difficult problems. [applause]
So, I know there are a lot of hard choices ahead of us. I wrote a book called ""Hard Choices."" There is it. There is it. I'll sign that for you. But I think we're more than up to it. You know, I am a confident optimist about where America's future lies. That doesn't mean I'm not aware of how difficult it is. I'm going into this race with my eyes wide open about how hard it is to be the president of the United States. I have a little experience about that. And I have to tell you, I find it, you know, very reassuring because I do have that experience to know what's possible and how best to proceed. but I also know that we are living in an incredibly complicated time in American history. It is not a time for easy answers or glib answers or one-liners or applause lines. Those are all great. That's part of campaigning.
But at the end of the day, we need a president who has both the experience and the understanding to deal with the complexity of the problems that we face. And I appreciate what both Dean and Sarah said about the experiences that I've been privileged to have during the last decades. I really believe that I can go into that office on the very first day and begin to do what is required.
So I look forward to visiting with each and every one of you. I look forward to working with you, not only as we move toward the caucuses. I would be honored to have your support on February 1st. And then I will need your help as we move toward the general election because I don't want this election to be about me. I want to it to be about us and the agenda that we want to set for our country.
You know, when I campaigned so hard against then-Senator Obama, I was, you know, working as hard as I could. He was working as hard as he could. And at the end of the day, he won. And then I went to work to make sure he got elected our president. And I was so relieved and happy when that finally happened.
The Sunday after the election, Bill and I went for a walk in an area that Sarah would know, a big kind of nature preserve near where we both live, and we just wanted to let down because we'd been working so hard to elect then-President-Elect Obama. So we're wandering through the woods, and Bill's phone rings, which is sort of a miracle since we have terrible cell coverage there. And he pulled it out of his pocket and it was the president-elect. And he said, ""You know, I'd like to talk to you and Hillary."" And Bill said, ""Well, we're kind of in the middle of a forest. Can we get home and call you back?""
And so we did. And when he called back—when Bill called back, he talked to the president-elect and then I talked to him. And he said to me, ""I want you to come see me in Chicago."" And I said, ""Sure. When?"" He goes, ""As soon as you can get here."" And I said, ""Well, OK."" So the following Thursday, I went to Chicago and he asked me if I would serve as secretary of state.
And I said, ""You know, Mr. President-elect, I, you know, I really want to go back to the Senate. I'm very flattered, but there are a lot of other people who could do that."" ""No,"" he said. ""I know what I want and I want you to do this."" I said, ""Well, you know, Mr. President-elect, I really want to go back to the Senate and that's where I think I can best work with you and best serve you."" He goes, ""Look,"" he said, ""I don't want to hear from you again until you say yes."" [laughter] So, you know, I told him ""no,"" you know, again later. And he just said, ""Don't—don't call me until you say yes."" And I did tell my husband, I said, ""He's so persistent. I've told him no twice and he keeps saying, you know, I'm waiting for you to say yes."" And Bill said, ""Yeah, well, I asked you to marry me twice before you said yes."" [laughter]
So I guess there's a connection there. So then I—I stayed up that night and I—I thought, you know, supposed I'd been honored to win, and I had wanted this incredibly talented American to be in my cabinet and I'd asked him, I'd want him to say yes. And I thought, you know, what's what I have to do.
So I called him and I said, ""You know, President-elect, I would be honored to serve in your cabinet."" And we immediately got starting to work. A few months later, on my very first trip as secretary of state, I went to Asia. And I went in part because everybody I called, all of the leaders in the countries that I spoke with, were saying, ""You know, we just don't know whether the United States cares about us anymore; nobody's been paying any attention to us; you know, we're—we're kind of feeling like we're not important to you anymore."" I said, ""Well, you are, and the president feels that way; I feel that way; I will come see you.""
So I went out. And one of the countries that I went to was Indonesia, in part because it's a very important country, but also President Obama had a personal connection with it. And my idea was not only to talk to the leaders, but to talk to the people, what's called public diplomacy. So that as you were—as I was out there talking to presidents and prime ministers and others, I would also find ways of trying to connect to to tell people, ""Look, the United States really does care about the world we're trying to create together, and that's part of my message from our new president.""
So I went on a—I agreed to go on a show in Jakarta, which was their morning show. And it was like a combination of MTV and a reality show and all that. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. And so I go onto the set and people are jumping and they're singing and they're dancing. And it's called ""The Awesome Show.""
So I'm on ""The Awesome Show,"" and I'm talking a little bit to the interviewer. And then they ask people if they have any questions. And somebody in the audience says, ""I want to ask you, we saw you campaigned very hard against President Obama; he campaigned very hard against you. He won. You lost. And then he asked you to be his secretary of state. Why?""
And I realized, you know, in a lot of these new democracies and other places of course, you run against somebody and you lose, you could get exiled or imprisoned, even killed; not asked to be secretary of state. And so this was a very legitimate question. And I thought, ""I have to answer this in a very, you know, serious way that maybe they can understand in our democracy, you know, we do try to close ranks after we have hard elections,"" at least that's what we should be doing. I said, ""Well, you're right. We campaigned hard. He won. I lost. I then campaigned to get him elected. He asked me to be secretary of state, and I said yes for the same reason: We both love our country.""
And at the end of the day to me... [applause] ...that's what elections are supposed to be about. We can disagree and we will. We'll have all kinds of arguments, even, about the best way to do things. But we should be coming from a place of love—of loving our country and of respecting one another. And we have to rebuild this feeling in our country again.
We have too much work to be done. We have too many people who deserve a better shot at a future for themselves and their families. I want to be their champion. And with your help, I will get up every single day doing the best I can to make sure that the country we love is the country we deserve to have.
Thank you all. [applause]

I'm delighted to have this chance to talk more about small businesses. But I want to begin with what's happening more broadly with America's economy and America's families. Because I've always believed fundamentally that when our families are strong, our country is strong.
And we've come back from very tough economic times. I don't need to tell anybody here that. Our economy and our country are in much better shape today, and in large measure because families worked so hard. They took extra jobs, they skipped vacations, they scrimped and they postponed going to college they saved and made it work.
But the deck is still stacked for those at the top.
People aren't getting a fair shake. Something is wrong when CEOs earn more than 300 times than what the typical American worker earns and when hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate than a truck drivers or nurses.
I'm running for president because everyday Americans and their families need a champion and I want to be that champion. I want families to do more than just get by — I want you to get ahead and stay ahead. I want to make the words ""middle class"" mean something again.
Now, small businesses like Bike Tech and the ones you'll here about today have to be at the heart of that effort — creating jobs, driving growth, and giving millions of Americans the chance to live up to their God-given potential.
Now, I did not learn this from politics — I learned it from my father who was a small business man. He had a very small business, printing drapery fabrics and then went out and sold them. My mother, my brothers and I and occasionally a few day laborers would help out with the actual printing process. That's what put food on the table and gave us a solid middle class home.
Today, small businesses all over our country have worked their way back from the perfect storm of the crisis, when sales and credit, together, dried up at the same time. Businesses are finally starting to sort out how they can grow again, add jobs, and planning for the future.
But the deck is stacked here as well. Ask any small business owner, as I have, and they'll tell you: It is wrong that it is so easy for big corporations to get a break but so hard for small businesses even to get a loan. It shouldn't take longer to start a business in America than it does in Canada and France! But that is the fact.
I want to be a small business president. A president who does make it easier to start and run a small business in this country, so it seems less like a gamble and more like an opportunity. We have to level the playing field for our small businesses.
First, we need to cut the unnecessary red tape that costs small businesses time and money and keeps new entrepreneurs out. We should scrub federal regulations to find responsible ways to make life easier for small businesses, and we should offer new incentives to state and local governments to do the same, because that's where many of the obstacles still lie.
Second, we need to simplify tax filing and provide targeted credits and deductions for small businesses, not just the big corporations that can afford the lawyers and lobbyists to find every single loophole.
Third, we'll use technology to expand access for small businesses into new markets, whether it's across town, across the state, or across the world. That's what I did in partnership with eBay in Upstate New York when I was a Senator. We started a public-private partnership to help small businesses that had never sold beyond their local community reach customers very far away.
Fourth, and I want to emphasize this today, I will fight to level the playing field for small businesses so they can get the financing they need to build and hire… including women and minority entrepreneurs who face extra barriers. And this morning when I was reading the Des Moines Register — big head line: REPORT: Iowa Ranks Last for Women Owned Business. This could not be a more timely article for our discussion today and although it says Iowa has made some progress it says Iowa has seen the lowest growth in the most businesses owned by women from 1997 to 2015 and women owned companies have the least economic clout in Iowa and all the states and the District of Columbia. So this is a very important issue for our whole county but I think it is especially important for our friends here in Iowa because access to credit can be as important to growing a small business as it is for the big ones.
And you shouldn't have to be a Fortune 500 company to get a loan.
For many small businesses these loans have always come from community banks with deep local ties. But today those same local banks are being squeezed by regulations that don't make sense for their size and mission. Like endless examinations and paperwork designed for banks that measure their assets in the many billions. And when it gets harder for small banks to do their jobs it gets harder for small businesses to get their loans. We can ease these burdens for community banks without harming consumers — and without easing up one bit on the Wall Street. We should not apply the same restrictions on community banks as those needed by the big banks.
Let's be clear about this: It's not the big banks that need relief from Washington — it's small banks and small businesses. We should be doing more to rein in risky behavior on Wall Street and ""Too Big to Fail,"" banks not less.
I fully support the regulations in Dodd-Frank on the big banks but we should pass common sense community banking reform right now, however, the republicans in the congress insist on using this issue to give relief to community banks as a Trojan Horse for rolling back the protections for consumers and rolling back the rules for the big banks — as we're seeing right now in what Republicans are introducing — we should call it what it is: a cynical attempt to game the system for those at the top.
Our goal should be helping community banks serve their neighbors and customers the way they always have. To make it easier to give our responsible loans to responsible small businesses so they can do what they do best, create jobs and help families get ahead.
So I'm eager to hear the ideas from everyone around the table. And I see some elected officials in the audience and am eager to hear your ideas. What are the obstacles you've faced and how can you overcome them? What more can we do to help small businesses grow?

7,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5000,"May 20, 2015","Remarks in Chicago, Illinois",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=110270,Hillary Clinton,"Wow, what a great way to begin and to all of you especially Mary Carmen and LaKeisha thank you for speaking on behalf of providers and parents. We're going to hear from everybody as we go through our event today. I want to thank everyone at New Horizons for welcoming us to this facility. And to all my friends at SEIU as well.
We're here today to talk about childcare. But its important to understand that when we talk about childcare we're talking about the economy, we're talking about families, we're talking about fairness, we're talking about all of the values that we believe are necessary to raise healthy successful productive children in society today. I want to say just a few words about what's happening with our economy and more broadly about America's families. Because I think when our families are strong America is strong. And if we don't have strong families its really hard for us to be the kind of strong nation that sets the table for our children to do better.
We've come back from really tough economic times. The great recession just really knocked people to the ground. People lost their jobs, they lost their homes they postponed doing things like going to college, they had to keep working if they had a job even if they were at or beyond retirement. It really took a lot out of everybody. And we are in much better shape today in large measure because families made the sacrifice and worked really hard despite the odds. They took extra jobs like some of you they skipped what were really necessities but they figured out how to make them not as urgent a need, like not driving the car as much or not buying all the food that the family required. So everybody made it work.
But the deck is still stacked for those at the top. Something is wrong when top CEOs earn 300 times more than what the average worker earns and I heard a statistic the other day that was kind of related to what we're talking about today, if you take the salaries, the compensation, of the top 25 hedge fund managers in America, those 25 men make more than all the kindergarten teachers in the country put together. Now I happen to think that kindergarten teachers and child care providers and child development specialists are really important because they are the people that are helping to get our kids off to a good start working with families.
And I'm running for President because I think everyday Americans need a champion, a champion that gets up every single day and goes to work and goes to bat and does everything I can to help families just get by which is what you were talking about. I want you to get ahead and stay ahead. I want to make the words ""middle class"" mean something again.
Now, when we think about strong families being the backbone of our country, we have to recognize that our economy is different and our families are different. I was born in Chicago and the families of today are not exactly the same as the family I was born into. Most families need two incomes or two jobs if there is only one parent to make ends meet. And 40 percent of moms, just like LaKeisha, are now the sole or the primary breadwinners in their household. So that's a big different from the way it was when I and others here were growing up. Yet we haven't adjusted our economy or our government programs to take those differences into account. You know I can remember very well when I was a young lawyer before I had my daughter in my law firm where I worked in Arkansas, around 3 o'clock I'd see all the women who worked there sort of whispering into their phones and I didn't know why, but it was just like clockwork, well they were trying to make sure their kids got home safely because their kids were walking home or getting off the bus and going home waiting for mom to get home. And it wasn't accepted back then that you could be a good worker and a devoted parent at the same time, especially for women. But that kind of juggling act is what most of us do all the time now and therefore we have to adjust how we support families so that you can be the best you can be and how we support small businesses like so many child care providers so you can make a living while you do what you love.
So we know that with Moms and Dads squeezing every minute out of a 24-hour day and with you Mary Carmen saying you work 17 hours, it's hard to even find time to breathe. And many can't count on anybody being there to help you because everyone you know is working hard and trying to make ends meet.
So finding high quality, affordable, flexible childcare is more important than ever. But it's also harder than ever.
Federal and state funding for childcare has not kept up with changing times and rising demand. So it's no surprise that out-of-pocket childcare costs for families have soared by nearly 25 percent over the past decade. And now the Republican budget that is being worked on by the Congress would cut funding even more. Making it so much more difficult. America cannot turn its back on our children and our working parents. Family values are economic values. I'm going to be putting forth plans to fix this. We should do it now. And Republicans should either get on board or get out of the way.
Because it's now time for us to face reality. Our families need new solutions today, they need real help not promises. And I'm very clear about what I think needs to be done but I want to hear from all of you because what I'm doing in traveling around the country is taking ideas I have, some of which I have been developing for many years, but hearing from people on the front lines, whether its immigration or small business or today child care.
First, to bring down out-of-control family costs, we need to make investments in childcare a national priority.
What President Obama has proposed is a good start. I'll look for responsible ways to go even further, whether it's providing tax cuts to new parents or grants to states targeted for infants and toddlers. Whatever its going to take to give both LaKeisha and the providers more opportunities. And you know its embarrassing, I traveled to 112 countries as your Secretary of State, there are only 9 countries left in the world that have no form of paid family leave, and we are one of them. And the other ones are tiny countries, countries without many resources. Every other country has something that says, we think it's really important that moms bond with their newborn babies, we think its important that a dad can have some time, we think it's important that children can take care of their parents as those parents maybe are ill or failing. So we've got to have better systems in place with more support and we have to focus on quality so that all our kids have access to the best possible care. And many of you know how hard that is because you have two people helping you take care of 16 children. There are a lot of places where there would be one person trying to take care of 16 children. We have to reducing overcrowding and increasing training and most importantly we have to increase wages. Because you expect to make a living doing the most important job in the world if you have to sacrifice your own family. That doesn't make any sense to me at all.
So to all the childcare workers here today, I want you to know that the service and care you provide strengthens our economy, it strengthens families and helps prepare children. You should be valued for that, respected for that, and you should be paid for that.
Now I am a new Grandmother and it's really wonderful but just being around my new 7 1/2 month old granddaughter just reinforces what I believe, which is when when we short-change childcare workers, we short-change kids and short-change Americans' future. It makes it harder to retain the best staff. It makes it harder to keep up those high standards.
So we have to stand firmly together and united on behalf of your right to organize, your right to bargain collectively, your right to fighting together for the higher wages that reflect the value of your work. There is nothing more important to the family or to the support of the family, which you are, than caring for our youngest children.
That's why I so respect the vital work that SEIU is doing, under the leadership of President Mary Kay Henry, is so vital. I think it is absolutely essential.
And I want to say something else about it, when people talk to me about the need to improve our educations system, I agree, because I want every child to have the best possible education. But education starts at birth. Education starts when that little baby comes into the world. In fact we now know, because of brain research, that about 80% of the brain is actually developed by the age of 3 and 4. If we don't take care of our babies we are short changing them on their brain development and then when we get to kindergarten no matter how hard they try, no matter how much their mom says do your best, do your homework, no matter how hard their teacher works they're going to be at a disadvantage. That's wrong, it isn't right that a child like my grandchild will have all of these opportunities because we're reading and we're talking and we're singing but we're not working 17 hour days and we're not trying to get by on $5100 after the expenses are paid. So yea, we're going to make sure that Charlotte has every chance in the world but I want every baby, everyone your babies and every baby you take care of to have exactly the same chances.
Ultimately, this is, for me, about how we work together to give every child the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. You see it in their faces when they are put in your arms from the very first minute. You want to keep that light in their eyes, you want to make sure they have every opportunity to fulfill that God-given potential. And I'm here because I want to help you and the parents you serve unlock that potential, when we unlock the full potential of every American, we can unlock the full potential and prosperity of America.
So for me, this is as important an as anything else that I'm going to talk about in my campaign for president. Thank you.

There are a lot of longtime friends here; I won't try to mention everybody, but I do want to thank Susan and the entire board for DWC. And I want to thank Gilda, who I think has been in the state legislature since '92, started in elementary school and worked her way up. Former Governor Jim Hodges, we're delighted he is here, thank you. A national Democratic chair, a state Democratic chair, of course Don and Carroll Fowler, so happy to see them. Your candidate for the Senate last time, Joyce Dikerson, thank you Joyce.
I was thinking on the way down here that I first came to South Carolina as a young lawyer working for the Children's Defense Fund, started by your own South Carolina native Marian Wright Edelman from Bennettsville. I came back many times going to Renaissance weekend, going to Hilton Head, then going to Charleston. Made a lot of friends, had a lot of good times, and am thrilled to be back, and I'm back because I want to support you.
You know, the theme of this day of events is how to build a party and how to build a party that really respects and includes women and gives women in this state a chance to not only be at the table but at the head of the table. Carrying with them their Democratic experiences and their life experiences. And you're right, I am running to live again at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But I don't want to be there all by myself—I want Democrats elected from the local to the county to the state to the federal level, once again making the case that when Democrats win, Americans win.
I want to say just a few words about what's happening to America's families and what's happening with our economy. Because I've always believed fundamentally that when families are strong, America is strong.
And we've come through some really tough economic times. I looked at the statistics and South Carolina has pulled itself up and other places have as well. American families have made a lot of sacrifices. People lost jobs, people lost homes, people had to put college on the back burner, retirement on the back burner. But everybody just kept going. It took a lot of determination, and across America we're beginning to see the results of all that hard work. And I will say that there does seem to be a pattern, Democratic presidents, and there are two in particular that I'm thinking of, over the last 35 years, seem to inherit a mess of problems. Have you noticed that? So then they have to dig us out of the ditches they find themselves in and put us back on the right track, and of course I'm talking about Bill Clinton and Barrack Obama, but of course presidents don't do it alone—they do it with the American people. It's a partnership.
And today we are standing again, but we're not yet running. And we face a choice: Are we going to hand over our country once again to people and policies that crashed our economy before and that will shred all the progress we've made?
[Crowd shouts NO!]
Well that's obviously the right answer, but that's what this campaign is going to be about. Because we're going to have to stand up to the people who want to keep the deck stacked in favor of those at the top. We are going to fight to make sure that the success of our country is shared across the economy and that more families have the chance to get ahead and not just to get by but to stay moving forward with the kind of confidence and optimism that has always marked the best times in America.
It's time to make the words ""middle class"" mean something again. They should represent a solemn promise that anyone willing to work hard can earn a decent living and a better life, not just get by paycheck to paycheck.
That's the middle class I grew up in. My dad was a small businessman, and when I say small, it was small. He ran a small drapery printing business. And he literally had a print plant with big long tables that had silk screens, and sometimes my mother, my brothers, and I would help to pour the paint in and take the squeegee and then we'd walk down the table, print the fabrics, and then he'd go out and sell them. And it was a good decent middle-class life that he provided to my brothers and me. And I am so grateful, and there was never in my mind in fact that's what so many of us believed when we were growing up. The future seemed so unlimited—of course we had to fix a lot of things in the country, starting with civil rights and human rights, but the opportunity ladder always was held out there.
I just came from Kiki's Chicken and Waffles, which I highly recommend, and I was meeting with a group of African American businesswomen, and they were telling me what they needed to keep growing and build an even better future, it sounded so much like the conversation I remember around my dinner table. That's what links us together past all the other differences that sometimes divide us.
Being middle class in America should mean you feel in control of your own financial destiny.
It should mean you have a little more, so you can worry a little less.
It should mean that you can invest in your future and the future of your children, putting aside some for education, putting aside some for retirement.
You should be able to go to sleep at night knowing that everything you've worked for won't be lost in a flash because of decisions that are made or failed to be made in Washington.
So therefore, I want to be a president who makes corporations live up to the basic guarantee that when workers help produce record profits, those workers should get a real share of the rewards instead of it all going to those at the top.
And you know the statistic. Something is wrong when top CEOs earn 300 times more than a typical American worker, or here is my latest least favorite statistic, the 25 biggest hedge fund managers earn more than all the kindergarten teachers in America...combined. What does that say about our values and the importance of preparing our children through education to make it in a very competitive global economy?
Today, too many politicians who want to return to the same failed top-down economics are mouthing the words ""middle class."" But this is something you have to believe in and something you have to be ready to fight for. If those words are going to have meaning again, they've got to be backed up by real solutions, not empty rhetoric. And those solutions have to speak to the ways that the economy has changed.
Today, 40 percent of mothers are the sole or primary breadwinners in their household. And more Americans are working multiple jobs just to make ends meet. Parents are rushing home from work to get their kids home from school and maybe get them off to practice or rehearsal. They are squeezing every minute out of a 24-hour day with barely enough time to breathe, let alone relax.
I remember when I was a practicing lawyer back in Little Rock, and around 3 o'clock every afternoon all of the women who worked in the firm were hunched over their phones kind of whispering into them and at first I didn't know what was going on, and then I realized they were checking to see if their children got home safely.
Many people today can't count on relatives to pitch in because so many families now are scattered across the country. Now I happen to be extremely lucky because my amazing 8-month-old granddaughter lives near me, so I get to see her a lot.
But nobody expects everything to come easy, that's not part of life, we know that, but it shouldn't be quite so hard to get ahead and stay ahead.
So I do believe that everyday Americans and their families need a champion. A champion who will fight for them every single day. Not for some Americans but for all Americans. And I want to be that champion. I want to get up every single day going to work for you, standing up for you, making a difference for you.
Now, take the issue of equal pay. I don't think I'm letting you in on a secret when I say, too many women still earn less than men on the job. And women of color often make even less. And then there's the so called, motherhood penalty, with many women taking a pay cut when they have children. All this lost money adds up. For many families, we're talking about thousands of dollars every year. That's money that could go for rent or groceries or a new car or into the college fund. Now we could fix this. If Republicans would get on board, we in fact could fix this today but they won't.
One Republican candidate dismissed equal pay as ""a bogus issue."" Another said Congress was ""wasting time"" worrying about it. One even said that efforts to guarantee fair pay reminded him of the Soviet Union.
And to that I say what century are they living in?
But thankfully the American people know the truth. And the truth is that when any parent is short-changed, the entire family is short-changed. And when families are short-changed, America is short-changed. And therefore this is not a women's issue this is a family issue and an American economic issue.
And here's what we should do instead to close the wage gap. First, we should pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, which gives women the legal tools we need to fight discrimination at work.
I introduced this legislation in the Senate back in 2005 and kept sponsoring it again and again. Well it's time to get this done, once and for all.
Second, we should promote pay transparency across our economy to ensure women have the information they need to negotiate fairly. You can't stand up for equal pay if you don't know whether you're paid equally. You remember the Lilly Ledbetter case, she didn't know for the longest that she wasn't being paid the same as her male coworkers doing the same jobs. Postings for new jobs or promotions should come with salary ranges. Large companies should report on how fairly, or not, they're compensating workers, male or female.
And we should applaud those businesses and communities that are leading the way with best practices and real accountability. I think transparency when it comes to pay is our friend. The more we can bring it out from under the table to put it on top, the more information we can have to advocate for ourselves and advocate for each other.
Third, we need to raise wages for the lowest paid jobs in America -- which are, they are disproportionately held by women, especially women of color—we need to make it easier for more women to enter higher paying fields like science and engineering and technology. But I want to say something that a lot of people may not know even in this room full of activist and well informed democrats.
In most states today, waitresses, bartenders, hairstylists, and others who rely on tips are paid even lower than minimum wage.
Some are paid as little as two dollars and thirteen cents an hour. And they are also more likely to face exploitation, wage theft, and sexual harassment. Think about somebody you may know, think about the mom trying to succeed at work and give her kids the support they need with a job that pays her $2.13 an hour. And forces her to put up with some pretty awful behavior by clients or customers or bosses to try to get those tips to at least push it up to the federal minimum wage level.
And finally, we need workplace policies like paid leave and flexible scheduling that allow parents to take care of their obligations at home without sacrificing pay at work.
Now, it's no secret that on equal pay and so many other issues, we're up against some pretty powerful forces, political and economic, that will do say and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for America. I'm here to tell you I'm not afraid to take them on.
You know I've spent my adult life going to bat for children, families, and our country.
And I do know how hard this job I'm seeking is. I have seen it up close and personal. You're not going to catch me wondering what it's like. Instead I'm spending my time planning for what I will do for you when I get there.
All our Presidents come into office looking so vigorous. Think about what they look like on inauguration day and then we watch them they grow grayer and grayer, and by the time they leave they're as white as the building they live in.
Well, let me tell you, I may not be the youngest candidate in this race. But I have one big advantage. I've been coloring my hair for years. So you're not going to see me turn white in the White House. And you're also not going to see me shrink from a fight. I think by now people know I don't quit.
So I hope you'll join me. I hope you'll help me build this campaign, make it your own. Tell your friends to go to hillaryclinton.com, sign up to volunteer.
This election is not about me. It's about us. And it has to be about what we will do together to restore faith, confidence and optimism in the future and the country we love.
I want to end with a story, some of you might remember we had a pretty vigorous campaign in 2008.
I vaguely recall. And both President Obama and I worked really hard and he won and I lost and then I went to work to make sure he'd win. And I was so relieved, I was just so relieved when finally November 2008 came around and he did.
And then a few days after the election, my husband and I were taking a walk in a little forested area near where we live, and his phone went off, and he answered it, and it was the president-elect, who said, ""Bill, I need to talk to you, and I want to talk to Hillary."" And Bill said, ""Well, we're in the middle of a forest, but as soon as we get home we'll call."" So we did, and the president-elect talked to Bill about the ideas he had and the cabinet and economic problems that he was all of a sudden being confronted with that he hadn't even been told about to the extent they were. So Bill talked to him and then hands me the phone, and the president-elect says, ""I want you to come to Chicago to meet with me."" And so I said, ""Certainly, when would you like me to come?"" And he says, ""As soon as you can come."" And I thought he wanted to talk to me about what I would do in the Senate to try to support what he was going to be championing as president.
So I went a few days later, go into this big office building and sit down with the president-elect, and he says to me, ""I want you to be my secretary of state."" And I said ""Well, Mr. President-elect, I'm honored, I'm flattered, but there are so many other people,"" and I gave him names of people that I thought would have been great secretaries of state. And he says, ""No, no, I have to spend all my time dealing with this economy, it's worse than we were even told, and yet we have all these problems around the world and I need somebody who I can send out there to go anywhere to talk to anyone, and I want it to be you."" I said, ""Well, I can't tell you how moved I am, but I have to go back to the Senate."" And he said, ""Now, I don't want to hear from you until you say yes."" So I go back to the airport and get on the plane. I go back to New York and I'm thinking, you know, the right thing for me is to stay in the Senate, the people of New York had had a rough time. I became senator, and eight months later we had 9/11, and so I had spent most of my first term trying to help people and rebuild our city and protect it and everything and I just thought I needed to go back.
So I called the president-elect and said, ""You know, again I cannot tell you how honored I am, and I will support you in any way I can, but I need to go back to the Senate, and so I must say no, Mr. President elect."" He said, ""I told you I didn't want to hear from you until you're ready to say yes."" And so I say to my husband, you know, ""Can you believe this? I mean the president-elect has asked me to be secretary of state, I told him no twice, and he says he's not going to give up until I say yes."" Bill says, ""Well as I remember it, I asked you to marry me twice before you said yes. He said you might stop and think that maybe there is a pattern here."" So I stayed up all night ,and I thought, you know, suppose it had been reversed, and I had been fortunate enough to win, and I wanted somebody to be in my cabinet that I knew I could rely on and I had asked the president-elect. I would have wanted him to say yes, because the country was facing some very serious decisions. So I called him back the next day, and I said ""OK, Mr. President, I am honored, I will be your secretary of state,"" and from that moment on we began to talk and to work together.
Fast forward to my first trip I go to Asia in February 2009, and I go because when I started calling presidents, prime ministers, and foreign ministers. They all said we didn't know what to expect because nobody's been paying a lot of attention to us. And I said well that is going to change, because the president and I see Asia as a very important priority, and I will come, so I was on my way.
One of the countries I was going to was Indonesia, and I agreed to do both the private meetings with the leaders and press conferences, the kinds of things you see on TV, and to do a lot of what's called public diplomacy, where we would reach out to people, and we would basically say, we care about you we're back we want to work with you. Let's try to find ways that we can be partners and send a different message.
So I agreed to go on this show in Jakarta called the ""Awesome Show."" And it was the early morning show, and it was unlike anything I've even seen on our TV, and you know you see anything on our TV these days, people are jumping up and down, they're singing, they're dancing, and I'm sitting here thinking, ""Oh my gosh, I hope they don't ask me to sing or dance"". But thankfully they didn't. They did an interview, and then they said the audience, ""Does anybody have any questions?"" So somebody raised a hand and was called on. So this person said, ""I want to ask you something. We followed your election."" I found that people overseas followed our election, in some ways closer than some Americans, really followed it, and so this questioner said, ""We followed your election, it was really a hard, long-fought election"" because as you know our elections last forever compared to most other countries which have elections. And he says, ""We saw you and President Obama going at it, he was saying bad things about you, you were saying back things about him, and then all of a sudden you end up as his secretary of state? How does that work?"" And I thought, you know this is a really serious question, because in lots of places you run against somebody, you can be exiled, imprisoned, or killed, not made Secretary of State, so I thought that there was a moment here that if I could rev my brain up that maybe could reach particularly young people because Indonesia is a relatively young democracy. So I said, ""You're right, we ran a very hard campaign against each other. He won, I lost, and then I went to work for him because he and I shared many of the same positions about what should be done in the next presidency and then he won and then he asked me to be Secretary of State for the same reason, we both love our country.""
And no matter how hard this election or any election becomes we should remember that at the core we can have disagreements, and we will, we have different governing philosophies, we have different views about what works, what the evidence shows works about economic policies, that's all fair game, but we should show more respect toward each other and we should remember why we're doing this, because we love our country, and we want it to be the country of hope and potential for our children and our grandchildren that many of us saw come into being over the last decades so as I run for President we're going to have some very difficult challenges. We'll have disagreements, we'll have debates, but I want you to know that I will be remembering what I think should be at the core of every political campaign, how we treat one another, and how we care for this gift we've been given, the United States of America. Thank you very much.

Thank you so very much. I cannot tell you how personally honored I am to be here with all of you, to be at this historic institution. Let me start by thanking President Rudley, everyone at Texas Southern university. It's a great treat to be here, to have heard just briefly from Dr. Rudley and others about the incredible programs and progress and the fact that you graduated more than 1,000 young people into the world not so many days ago. This institution is the living legacy, the absolute embodiment of Heman Marion Sweatt and the long struggle for civil rights. and for me, to be surrounded by so many here in Houston, Texas, and indeed from across our country, who were part of that movement is especially touching. I am delighted to be here with my friend, Sheila Jackson Lee, she has been a tireless champion for the people of the 18th District and state and the country.
I have to tell you though I thought she would tell you about the most important news coming out of Congress. And that is she is finally a member of the grandmother's club. And as a member of now a little over eight months, it is the best club you will ever be a member of, Sheila. I have to tell you I was excited to come here and to talk about an issue that is important to Barbara Jordan and should be important to all of us. But to do so in front of Dr. Freeman is a little daunting. I mean anyone who knows what this man has meant, not only to Barbara Jordan but to so many who have studied here who have been in anyway effected by his brilliant teaching, elocution and delivery would be a little daunted too. I noticed that both Dr. Rudley and Dr. Sheila both got off before Dr. Freeman came up.
I also want to say my thoughts and prayers are with all the families in Houston and across Texas affected by the recent terrible flooding. And I am confident that this community will embrace them. I remember very well coming here after Katrina with my husband, and in fact we decided to invite along a young Senator from Illinois by the name of Barack Obama, along and with Sheila and other leaders in the community. We toured the facilities that Houston had provided to those who were fleeing that horrific storm. And I saw how people had opened their hearts and their homes. This is a city that knows how to pull together, and I'm confident you'll do so again on behalf of those who are suffering from this latest terrible disaster.
And it is also a special moment to be here, knowing that Barbara Jordan was succeeded by Mickey Leland and the 18th District was so well represented for so long, and I am delighted to be here with Alison and to remember the pioneering work he did on behalf of children and the poor and hungry. So many issues that he was the champion of. And I want to thank Rosemary McGowan and all the friends and loved ones of Barbara Jordan here today. This is such a particular honor for me because the award is in memory of one of my true personal heroes—a woman who taught me and so many others the meaning of courage and determination in the pursuit of justice.
I first met Barbara Jordan when I was a young attorney and had been given a position working for the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee investigating Richard Nixon, and it was such a profound moment in American history. And there wasn't anyone who was a more effective eloquent inquisitor than Barbara Jordan.
As a 26-year-old fresh out of law school, as some of you are perhaps now having graduated from the Thurgood Marshall School here at TSU, I was riveted and not a little intimidated to tell you the truth by this unstoppable Congresswoman from Texas. I got to talk with her, which was thrilling, I got to hand her papers, which was equally exciting, but mostly I got to watch and listen to her.
At a time of shaken confidence, she stirred the entire nation with her words.
Remember what she said: ""My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete; it is total.""
It was that passion and moral clarity that took Barbara Jordan from the TSU and the halls of Texas legislature all the ways to the halls of Congress. The first woman and the first African American ever elected to represent Texas in the House of Representatives.
And she defended and continued the civil rights legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and her friend and mentor President Lyndon Johnson—and in particular she was a staunch advocate for the Voting Rights Act, which had helped make it possible for her to be elected.
In 1975, in the face of fierce opposition, Barbara Jordan led the fight to extend the special protections of the Voting Rights Act to many more Americans, including Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans as well.
And like every woman who has run for national office in this country in the last four decades, I stand here on the shoulders of Barbara Jordan and so does our entire country.
And boy do we miss her. We miss her courage, we also miss her humor, she was funny and most of all her irresistible voice.
I remember talking to her and Ann Richards one time. And between the two of them, forget trying to get a word in at all. And they were telling me about how they would love to go to the University of Texas women's basketball games. Right, and Barbara would be there by that time in her wheelchair, and Ann would be holding court right next to her. And Barbara would be yelling directions like she was, you know, the coach. ""Why are you doing that? Jump higher! That's not a pass!"" You know, all of those kinds of sideline comments. And so Ann was telling me this, with Barbara right there and I finally turned to her and said, ""Barbara, encourage these young women, don't just criticize them."" And Barbara turned around and said, ""When they deserve it, I will.""
We sure could use her irresistible voice. I wish we could hear that voice one more time.
Hear her express the outrage we feel about the fact that 40 years after Barbara Jordan fought to extend the Voting Rights Act, its heart has been ripped out.
And I wish we could hear her speak up for the student who has to wait for hours for his or her right to vote. For the grandmother who's turned away from the polls because her driver's license expired. For the father who's done his time and paid his debt to society but still hasn't gotten his rights back.
Now we know, unfortunately, Barbara isn't here to speak up for them and so many others. But we are. And we have a responsibility to say clearly and directly what's really going on in our country—because what is happening is a sweeping effort to disempower and disenfranchise people of color, poor people, and young people from one end of our country to the other.
Because since the Supreme Court eviscerated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, many of the states that previously faced special scrutiny because of a history of racial discrimination have proposed and passed new laws that make it harder than ever to vote.
North Carolina passed a bill that went after pretty much anything that makes voting more convenient or more accessible. Early voting. Same-day registration. The ability of county election officials to even extend voting hours to accommodate long lines.
Now what possible reason could there be to end pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds and eliminate voter outreach in high schools?
We should be doing everything we can to get our young people more engaged in democracy, not less.
In fact I would say it is a cruel irony—but no coincidence—that Millennials, the most diverse, tolerant, and inclusive generation in American history, are now facing so much exclusion.
And we need look no further than right here in Texas. You all know this far better than I, but if you want to vote in this state, you can use a concealed weapon permit as a valid form of identification—but a valid student ID isn't good enough?
Now, Krystal Watson found out the hard way. She grew up in Louisiana but came to Marshall, Texas, to attend Wiley College. Krystal takes her responsibilities as a citizen so seriously that not only did she register to vote in Texas, where she was living and would be for a number of years, she even became a deputy registrar to help other people vote as well. But this past year, when she showed up at her local polling place with a Wiley College ID, she was turned away.
Experts estimate that hundreds of thousands of registered voters in Texas may face similar situations.
And while high-profile state laws like those in Texas and North Carolina get most of the attention, many of the worst offenses against the right to vote actually happen below the radar. Like when authorities shift poll locations and election dates. Or scrap language assistance for non-English speakers—something Barbara Jordan fought so hard for.
Without the pre-clearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act, no one outside the local community is likely to ever hear about these abuses, let alone have a chance to challenge them and end them.
It's not a surprise for you to hear that studies and everyday experiences confirm that minority voters are more likely than white voters to wait in long lines at the polls. They are also far more likely to vote in polling places with insufficient numbers of voting machines.
In South Carolina, for example, there's supposed to be one machine for every 250 voters. But in minority areas, that rule is just often overlooked. In Richland Country, nearly 90 percent of the precincts failed to meet the standard required by law in 2012. Instead of 250 voters per machine, in one precinct it was more than 430 voters per machine. Not surprisingly, people trying to cast a ballot there faced massive delays.
Now there are many fair-minded, well-intentioned election officials and state legislators all over this country. But this kind of disparity that I just mentioned does not happen by accident.
Now some of you may have heard me or my husband say one of our favorite sayings from Arkansas, of course I learned it from him. ""You find a turtle on a fence post, it did not get there on its own."" Well, all of these problems with voting did not just happen by accident. And it is just wrong, it's wrong to try to prevent, undermine, inhibit Americans' rights to vote. Its counter to the values we share. And at a time when so many Americans have lost trust in our political system, it's the opposite of what we should be doing in our country.
This is the greatest, longest-lasting democracy in the history of the world. We should be clearing the way for more people to vote, not putting up every roadblock anyone can imagine.
Yet unfortunately today, there are people who offer themselves to be leaders whose actions have undercut this fundamental American principle.
Here in Texas, former Governor Rick Perry signed a law that a federal court said was actually written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters. He applauded when the Voting Rights Act was gutted, and said the lost protections were ""outdated and unnecessary.""
But Governor Perry is hardly alone in his crusade against voting rights.
In Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker cut back early voting and signed legislation that would make it harder for college students to vote.
In New Jersey, Governor Christie vetoed legislation to extend early voting.
And in Florida, when Jeb Bush was governor, state authorities conducted a deeply flawed purge of voters before the presidential election in 2000.
Thankfully in 2004 a plan to purge even more voters was headed off.
So today, Republicans are systematically and deliberately trying to stop millions of American citizens from voting. What part of democracy are they afraid of?
I believe every citizen has the right to vote. And I believe we should do everything we can to make it easier for every citizen to vote.
I call on Republicans at all levels of government with all manner of ambition to stop fear mongering about a phantom epidemic of election fraud and start explaining why they're so scared of letting citizens have their say.
Yes, this is about democracy. But it's also about dignity. About the ability to stand up and say, yes, I am a citizen. I am an American. My voice counts. And no matter where you come from or what you look like or how much money you have, that means something. In fact, it means a lot.
I learned those lessons right here in Texas, registering voters in south Texas down in the valley in 1972.
Some of the people I met were, understandably, a little wary of a girl from Chicago who didn't speak a word of Spanish. But they wanted to vote. They were citizens. They knew they had a right to be heard. They wanted to exercise all the rights and responsibilities that citizenship conveys. That's what should matter because when those rights are denied to anyone, we're all the worse for it. It doesn't just hold back the aspirations of individual citizens. It holds back our entire country.
That's why, as a Senator, I championed a bill called the Count Every Vote Act. If it had become law, it would have made Election Day a federal holiday and mandated early voting opportunities. Deceiving voters, including by sending flyers into minority neighborhoods with false voting times and places, would have become a federal crime. And many Americans with criminal convictions who had paid their debts to society would have finally gotten their voting rights back.
Well today, with the damage to the Voting Rights Act so severe, the need for action is even more urgent.
First, Congress should move quickly to pass legislation to repair that damage and restore the full protections that American voters need and deserve.
I was in the Senate in 2006 when we voted 98 to zero to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act after an exhaustive review process.
There had been more than 20 hearings in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Testimony from expert witnesses. Investigative reports documenting continuing discrimination in covered jurisdictions. There were more than 15,000 pages of legislative record. Now that is how the system is supposed to work. You gather the evidence, you weigh it and you decide. And we did 98 to nothing. We put principle ahead of politics. That is what Congress needs to do again.
Second, we should implement the recommendations of the bipartisan presidential commission to improve voting. That commission was chaired by President Obama's campaign lawyer and by Governor Mitt Romney campaign's lawyer. And they actually agreed. And they set forth common sense reforms, including expanding early, absentee, and mail voting. Providing online voter registration. Establishing the principle that no one should ever have to wait more than 30 minutes to cast your vote.
Third, we should set a standard across our country of at least 20 days of early in-person voting everywhere—including opportunities for weekend and evening voting. If families coming out of church on Sunday before an election are inspired to go vote, they should be free to do just that. And we know that early in-person voting will reduce those long lines and give more citizens the chance to participate, especially those who have work or family obligations that make it difficult to get to the polls on Election Day.
It's not just convenient—it's also more secure, more reliable, and more affordable than absentee voting. So let's get this done.
And I believe we should go even further to strengthen voting rights in America. So today I am calling for universal, automatic voter registration. Every citizen, every state in the Union. Everyone, every young man or young woman should be automatically registered to vote when they turn 18—unless they actively choose to opt out. But I believe this would have a profound impact on our elections and our democracy. Between a quarter and a third of all eligible Americans remain unregistered and therefore unable to vote.
And we should modernize our entire approach to registration. The current system is a relic from an earlier age. It relies on a blizzard of paper records and it's full of errors.
We can do better. We can make sure that registration rolls are secure, up to date, and complete. When you move, your registration should move with you. If you are an eligible vote and want to be registered, you should be a registered voter—period.
Now, Oregon is already leading the way modernizing its system, and the rest of the country should follow. The technology is there. States have a lot of the data already. It's just a matter of syncing and streamlining.
Now, all of these reforms, from expanded early voting to modernized registration, are common sense ways to strengthen our democracy. But I'll be candid here, none of them will come easily.
It's going to take leadership at many levels.
Now more than ever, we need our citizens to actually get out and vote for people who want to hear what is on their minds.
We need more activists working to expose abuses, educate Americans about their rights, and hold authorities accountable for protecting them. Some of the worst provisions in recent laws have been blocked or delayed by tireless advocates raising the alarm and filing legal challenges. But they can't do it alone.
We need more grassroots mobilization efforts like the Moral Monday movement in North Carolina to build momentum for reform.
We need more Justices on the Supreme Court who will protect every citizen's right to vote, I mean the principle underlying our Constitution, which we had to fight for a long time to make apply to everybody, one person, one vote and we need a Supreme Court that cares more about protecting the right to vote of a person than the right to buy and election of a corporation.
But of course, you know what we really need? We need more elected leaders from Houston to Austin to Washington who will follow in the footsteps of Barbara Jordan and fight for the rights and opportunities of everyday Americans, not just those at the top of the ladder. And we need to remember that progress is built on common ground, not scorched earth.
You know, when I traveled around the world as your Secretary of State, one of the most frequent questions I was asked was, ""How could you and President Obama work together after you fought so hard in that campaign?""
People were genuinely amazed, which I suppose is understandable, considering that in many places, when you lose an election or you oppose someone who wins you could get imprisoned or exiled—even killed—not hired as Secretary of State.
And it's true, I was surprised when the President asked me to serve. But he made that offer, and I accepted it, because we both love our country.
So my friends, here at this historic institution let us remember that America was built by people who knew that our common interest was more important than our self-interest. They were fearless in pursuit of a stronger, freer, and fairer nation.
As Barbara Jordan famously reminded us, when the Constitution was first written, it left most of us here out. But generations of Americans fought and marched and organized and prayed to expand the circle of freedom and opportunity. They never gave up and never backed down.
And nearly a century ago on this very day, after years of struggle, Congress finally passed the 19th amendment to give women the right to vote in the United States.
So that is, that is the story of progress, courageous men and women, expanding rights, not restricting them. And today we refuse, we refuse to allow our country or this generation of leaders to slow or reverse America's long march toward a more perfect union.
We owe it to our children and grandchildren to fight just as hard as those who came before us did. To march just as far. To organize just as well. To speak out just as loudly. And to vote, every chance we get for the kind of future we want.
That's what Barbara Jordan would do. That's what we should do in honor of her.
Thank you, and may God bless you.

Oh, thank you all! Thank you so very, very much.
It is wonderful to be here with all of you.
To be in New York with my family, with so many friends, including many New Yorkers who gave me the honor of serving them in the Senate for eight years.
To be right across the water from the headquarters of the United Nations, where I represented our country many times.
To be here in this beautiful park dedicated to Franklin Roosevelt's enduring vision of America, the nation we want to be.
And in a place... with absolutely no ceilings.
You know, President Roosevelt's Four Freedoms are a testament to our nation's unmatched aspirations and a reminder of our unfinished work at home and abroad. His legacy lifted up a nation and inspired presidents who followed. One is the man I served as Secretary of State, Barack Obama, and another is my husband, Bill Clinton.
Two Democrats guided by the — Oh, that will make him so happy. They were and are two Democrats guided by the fundamental American belief that real and lasting prosperity must be built by all and shared by all.
President Roosevelt called on every American to do his or her part, and every American answered. He said there's no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous America: ""Equality of opportunity... Jobs for those who can work... Security for those who need it... The ending of special privilege for the few... The preservation of civil liberties for all... a wider and constantly rising standard of living.""
That still sounds good to me.
It's America's basic bargain. If you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead. And when everybody does their part, America gets ahead too.
That bargain inspired generations of families, including my own.
It's what kept my grandfather going to work in the same Scranton lace mill every day for 50 years.
It's what led my father to believe that if he scrimped and saved, his small business printing drapery fabric in Chicago could provide us with a middle-class life. And it did.
When President Clinton honored the bargain, we had the longest peacetime expansion in history, a balanced budget, and the first time in decades we all grew together, with the bottom 20 percent of workers increasing their incomes by the same percentage as the top 5 percent.
When President Obama honored the bargain, we pulled back from the brink of Depression, saved the auto industry, provided health care to 16 million working people, and replaced the jobs we lost faster than after a financial crash.
But, it's not 1941, or 1993, or even 2009. We face new challenges in our economy and our democracy.
We're still working our way back from a crisis that happened because time-tested values were replaced by false promises.
Instead of an economy built by every American, for every American, we were told that if we let those at the top pay lower taxes and bend the rules, their success would trickle down to everyone else.
What happened?
Well, instead of a balanced budget with surpluses that could have eventually paid off our national debt, the Republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest, borrowed money from other countries to pay for two wars, and family incomes dropped. You know where we ended up.
Except it wasn't the end.
As we have since our founding, Americans made a new beginning.
You worked extra shifts, took second jobs, postponed home repairs... you figured out how to make it work. And now people are beginning to think about their future again — going to college, starting a business, buying a house, finally being able to put away something for retirement.
So we're standing again. But, we all know we're not yet running the way America should.
You see corporations making record profits, with CEOs making record pay, but your paychecks have barely budged.
While many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of America's kindergarten teachers combined. And, often paying a lower tax rate.
So, you have to wonder: ""When does my hard work pay off? When does my family get ahead?"" ""When?""
I say now.
Prosperity can't be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers.
Democracy can't be just for billionaires and corporations.
Prosperity and democracy are part of your basic bargain too.
You brought our country back.
Now it's time — your time to secure the gains and move ahead.
And, you know what?
America can't succeed unless you succeed.
That is why I am running for President of the United States.
Here, on Roosevelt Island, I believe we have a continuing rendezvous with destiny. Each American and the country we cherish.
I'm running to make our economy work for you and for every American.
For the successful and the struggling.
For the innovators and inventors.
For those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases.
For the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day.
For the nurses who work the night shift.
For the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us.
For the veterans who served our country.
For the small business owners who took a risk.
For everyone who's ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out.
I'm not running for some Americans, but for all Americans.
Our country's challenges didn't begin with the Great Recession and they won't end with the recovery.
For decades, Americans have been buffeted by powerful currents.
Advances in technology and the rise of global trade have created whole new areas of economic activity and opened new markets for our exports, but they have also displaced jobs and undercut wages for millions of Americans.
The financial industry and many multi-national corporations have created huge wealth for a few by focusing too much on short-term profit and too little on long-term value... too much on complex trading schemes and stock buybacks, too little on investments in new businesses, jobs, and fair compensation.
Our political system is so paralyzed by gridlock and dysfunction that most Americans have lost confidence that anything can actually get done. And they've lost trust in the ability of both government and Big Business to change course.
Now, we can blame historic forces beyond our control for some of this, but the choices we've made as a nation, leaders and citizens alike, have also played a big role.
Our next President must work with Congress and every other willing partner across our entire country. And I will do just that — to turn the tide so these currents start working for us more than against us.
At our best, that's what Americans do. We're problem solvers, not deniers. We don't hide from change, we harness it.
But we can't do that if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before.
Americans have come too far to see our progress ripped away.
Now, there may be some new voices in the presidential Republican choir, but they're all singing the same old song...
A song called ""Yesterday.""
You know the one — all our troubles look as though they're here to stay... and we need a place to hide away... They believe in yesterday.
And you're lucky I didn't try singing that, too, I'll tell you!
These Republicans trip over themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse.
We've heard this tune before. And we know how it turns out.
Ask many of these candidates about climate change, one of the defining threats of our time, and they'll say: ""I'm not a scientist."" Well, then, why don't they start listening to those who are?
They pledge to wipe out tough rules on Wall Street, rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky, courting future failures. In a case that can only be considered mass amnesia.
They want to take away health insurance from more than 16 million Americans without offering any credible alternative.
They shame and blame women, rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions.
They want to put immigrants, who work hard and pay taxes, at risk of deportation.
And they turn their backs on gay people who love each other.
Fundamentally, they reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy. It takes an inclusive society. What I once called ""a village"" that has a place for everyone.
Now, my values and a lifetime of experiences have given me a different vision for America.
I believe that success isn't measured by how much the wealthiest Americans have, but by how many children climb out of poverty...
How many start-ups and small businesses open and thrive...
How many young people go to college without drowning in debt...
How many people find a good job...
How many families get ahead and stay ahead.
I didn't learn this from politics. I learned it from my own family.
My mother taught me that everybody needs a chance and a champion. She knew what it was like not to have either one.
Her own parents abandoned her, and by 14 she was out on her own, working as a housemaid. Years later, when I was old enough to understand, I asked what kept her going.
You know what her answer was? Something very simple: Kindness from someone who believed she mattered.
The 1st grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and, without embarrassing her, brought extra food to share.
The woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work got done. That was a bargain she leapt to accept.
And, because some people believed in her, she believed in me.
That's why I believe with all my heart in America and in the potential of every American.
To meet every challenge.
To be resilient... no matter what the world throws at you.
To solve the toughest problems.
I believe we can do all these things because I've seen it happen.
As a young girl, I signed up at my Methodist Church to babysit the children of Mexican farmworkers, while their parents worked in the fields on the weekends. And later, as a law student, I advocated for Congress to require better working and living conditions for farm workers whose children deserved better opportunities.
My first job out of law school was for the Children's Defense Fund. I walked door-to-door to find out how many children with disabilities couldn't go to school, and to help build the case for a law guaranteeing them access to education.
As a leader of the Legal Services Corporation, I defended the right of poor people to have a lawyer. And saw lives changed because an abusive marriage ended or an illegal eviction stopped.
In Arkansas, I supervised law students who represented clients in courts and prisons, organized scholarships for single parents going to college, led efforts for better schools and health care, and personally knew the people whose lives were improved.
As Senator, I had the honor of representing brave firefighters, police officers, EMTs, construction workers, and volunteers who ran toward danger on 9/11 and stayed there, becoming sick themselves.
It took years of effort, but Congress finally approved the health care they needed.
There are so many faces and stories that I carry with me of people who gave their best and then needed help themselves.
Just weeks ago, I met another person like that, a single mom juggling a job and classes at community college, while raising three kids.
She doesn't expect anything to come easy. But she did ask me: What more can be done so it isn't quite so hard for families like hers?
I want to be her champion and your champion.
If you'll give me the chance, I'll wage and win Four Fights for you.
The first is to make the economy work for everyday Americans, not just those at the top.
To make the middle class mean something again, with rising incomes and broader horizons. And to give the poor a chance to work their way into it.
The middle class needs more growth and more fairness. Growth and fairness go together. For lasting prosperity, you can't have one without the other.
Is this possible in today's world?
I believe it is or I wouldn't be standing here.
Do I think it will be easy? Of course not.
But, here's the good news: There are allies for change everywhere who know we can't stand by while inequality increases, wages stagnate, and the promise of America dims. We should welcome the support of all Americans who want to go forward together with us.
There are public officials who know Americans need a better deal.
Business leaders who want higher pay for employees, equal pay for women and no discrimination against the LGBT community either.
There are leaders of finance who want less short-term trading and more long-term investing.
There are union leaders who are investing their own pension funds in putting people to work to build tomorrow's economy. We need everyone to come to the table and work with us.
In the coming weeks, I'll propose specific policies to:
Reward businesses who invest in long term value rather than the quick buck — because that leads to higher growth for the economy, higher wages for workers, and yes, bigger profits, everybody will have a better time.
I will rewrite the tax code so it rewards hard work and investments here at home, not quick trades or stashing profits overseas.
I will give new incentives to companies that give their employees a fair share of the profits their hard work earns.
We will unleash a new generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners by providing tax relief, cutting red tape, and making it easier to get a small business loan.
We will restore America to the cutting edge of innovation, science, and research by increasing both public and private investments.
And we will make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.
Developing renewable power — wind, solar, advanced biofuels...
Building cleaner power plants, smarter electric grids, greener buildings...
Using additional fees and royalties from fossil fuel extraction to protect the environment...
And ease the transition for distressed communities to a more diverse and sustainable economic future from coal country to Indian country, from small towns in the Mississippi Delta to the Rio Grande Valley to our inner cities, we have to help our fellow Americans.
Now, this will create millions of jobs and countless new businesses, and enable America to lead the global fight against climate change.
We will also connect workers to their jobs and businesses. Customers will have a better chance to actually get where they need and get what they desire with roads, railways, bridges, airports, ports, and broadband brought up to global standards for the 21st century.
We will establish an infrastructure bank and sell bonds to pay for some of these improvements.
Now, building an economy for tomorrow also requires investing in our most important asset, our people, beginning with our youngest.
That's why I will propose that we make preschool and quality childcare available to every child in America.
And I want you to remember this, because to me, this is absolutely the most-compelling argument why we should do this. Research tells us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact lifelong success. In fact, 80 percent of the brain is developed by age three.
One thing I've learned is that talent is universal — you can find it anywhere — but opportunity is not. Too many of our kids never have the chance to learn and thrive as they should and as we need them to.
Our country won't be competitive or fair if we don't help more families give their kids the best possible start in life.
So let's staff our primary and secondary schools with teachers who are second to none in the world, and receive the respect they deserve for sparking the love of learning in every child.
Let's make college affordable and available to all ...and lift the crushing burden of student debt.
Let's provide lifelong learning for workers to gain or improve skills the economy requires, setting up many more Americans for success.
Now, the second fight is to strengthen America's families, because when our families are strong, America is strong.
And today's families face new and unique pressures. Parents need more support and flexibility to do their job at work and at home.
I believe you should have the right to earn paid sick days.
I believe you should receive your work schedule with enough notice to arrange childcare or take college courses to get ahead.
I believe you should look forward to retirement with confidence, not anxiety.
That you should have the peace of mind that your health care will be there when you need it, without breaking the bank.
I believe we should offer paid family leave so no one has to choose between keeping a paycheck and caring for a new baby or a sick relative.
And it is way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job — and women of color often making even less.
This isn't a women's issue. It's a family issue. Just like raising the minimum wage is a family issue. Expanding childcare is a family issue. Declining marriage rates is a family issue. The unequal rates of incarceration is a family issue. Helping more people with an addiction or a mental health problem get help is a family issue.
In America, every family should feel like they belong.
So we should offer hard-working, law-abiding immigrant families a path to citizenship. Not second-class status.
And, we should ban discrimination against LGBT Americans and their families so they can live, learn, marry, and work just like everybody else.
You know, America's diversity, our openness, our devotion to human rights and freedom is what's drawn so many to our shores. What's inspired people all over the world. I know. I've seen it with my own eyes.
And these are also qualities that prepare us well for the demands of a world that is more interconnected than ever before.
So we have a third fight: to harness all of America's power, smarts, and values to maintain our leadership for peace, security, and prosperity.
No other country on Earth is better positioned to thrive in the 21st century. No other country is better equipped to meet traditional threats from countries like Russia, North Korea, and Iran — and to deal with the rise of new powers like China.
No other country is better prepared to meet emerging threats from cyber attacks, transnational terror networks like ISIS, and diseases that spread across oceans and continents.
As your President, I'll do whatever it takes to keep Americans safe.
And if you look over my left shoulder you can see the new World Trade Center soaring skyward.
As a Senator from New York, I dedicated myself to getting our city and state the help we needed to recover. And as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I worked to maintain the best-trained, best-equipped, strongest military, ready for today's threats and tomorrow's.
And when our brave men and women come home from war or finish their service, I'll see to it that they get not just the thanks of a grateful nation, but the care and benefits they've earned.
I've stood up to adversaries like Putin and reinforced allies like Israel. I was in the Situation Room on the day we got bin Laden.
But, I know — I know we have to be smart as well as strong.
Meeting today's global challenges requires every element of America's power, including skillful diplomacy, economic influence, and building partnerships to improve lives around the world with people, not just their governments.
There are a lot of trouble spots in the world, but there's a lot of good news out there too.
I believe the future holds far more opportunities than threats if we exercise creative and confident leadership that enables us to shape global events rather than be shaped by them.
And we all know that in order to be strong in the world, though, we first have to be strong at home. That's why we have to win the fourth fight — reforming our government and revitalizing our democracy so that it works for everyday Americans.
We have to stop the endless flow of secret, unaccountable money that is distorting our elections, corrupting our political process, and drowning out the voices of our people.
We need Justices on the Supreme Court who will protect every citizen's right to vote, rather than every corporation's right to buy elections.
If necessary, I will support a constitutional amendment to undo the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United.
I want to make it easier for every citizen to vote. That's why I've proposed universal, automatic registration and expanded early voting.
I'll fight back against Republican efforts to disempower and disenfranchise young people, poor people, people with disabilities, and people of color.
What part of democracy are they afraid of?
No matter how easy we make it to vote, we still have to give Americans something worth voting for.
Government is never going to have all the answers — but it has to be smarter, simpler, more efficient, and a better partner.
That means access to advanced technology so government agencies can more effectively serve their customers, the American people.
We need expertise and innovation from the private sector to help cut waste and streamline services.
There's so much that works in America. For every problem we face, someone somewhere in America is solving it. Silicon Valley cracked the code on sharing and scaling a while ago. Many states are pioneering new ways to deliver services. I want to help Washington catch up.
To do that, we need a political system that produces results by solving problems that hold us back, not one overwhelmed by extreme partisanship and inflexibility.
Now, I'll always seek common ground with friend and opponent alike. But I'll also stand my ground when I must.
That's something I did as Senator and Secretary of State — whether it was working with Republicans to expand health care for children and for our National Guard, or improve our foster care and adoption system, or pass a treaty to reduce the number of Russian nuclear warheads that could threaten our cities — and it's something I will always do as your President.
We Americans may differ, bicker, stumble, and fall; but we are at our best when we pick each other up, when we have each other's back.
Like any family, our American family is strongest when we cherish what we have in common, and fight back against those who would drive us apart.
People all over the world have asked me: ""How could you and President Obama work together after you fought so hard against each other in that long campaign?""
Now, that is an understandable question considering that in many places, if you lose an election you could get imprisoned or exiled — even killed — not hired as Secretary of State.
But President Obama asked me to serve, and I accepted because we both love our country. That's how we do it in America.
With that same spirit, together, we can win these four fights.
We can build an economy where hard work is rewarded.
We can strengthen our families.
We can defend our country and increase our opportunities all over the world.
And we can renew the promise of our democracy.
If we all do our part. In our families, in our businesses, unions, houses of worship, schools, and, yes, in the voting booth.
I want you to join me in this effort. Help me build this campaign and make it your own.
Talk to your friends, your family, your neighbors.

It's no secret that we're going up against some pretty powerful forces that will do and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for America. But I've spent my life fighting for children, families, and our country. And I'm not stopping now.
You know, I know how hard this job is. I've seen it up close and personal.
All our Presidents come into office looking so vigorous. And then we watch their hair grow grayer and grayer.
Well, I may not be the youngest candidate in this race. But I will be the youngest woman President in the history of the United States!
And the first grandmother as well.
And one additional advantage: You're won't see my hair turn white in the White House. I've been coloring it for years!
So I'm looking forward to a great debate among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I'm not running to be a President only for those Americans who already agree with me. I want to be a President for all Americans.
And along the way, I'll just let you in on this little secret. I won't get everything right. Lord knows I've made my share of mistakes. Well, there's no shortage of people pointing them out!
And I certainly haven't won every battle I've fought. But leadership means perseverance and hard choices. You have to push through the setbacks and disappointments and keep at it.
I think you know by now that I've been called many things by many people — ""quitter"" is not one of them.
Like so much else in my life, I got this from my mother.
When I was a girl, she never let me back down from any bully or barrier. In her later years, Mom lived with us, and she was still teaching me the same lessons. I'd come home from a hard day at the Senate or the State Department, sit down with her at the small table in our breakfast nook, and just let everything pour out. And she would remind me why we keep fighting, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.
I can still hear her saying: ""Life's not about what happens to you, it's about what you do with what happens to you — so get back out there.""
She lived to be 92 years old, and I often think about all the battles she witnessed over the course of the last century — all the progress that was won because Americans refused to give up or back down.
She was born on June 4, 1919 — before women in America had the right to vote. But on that very day, after years of struggle, Congress passed the Constitutional Amendment that would change that forever.
The story of America is a story of hard-fought, hard-won progress. And it continues today. New chapters are being written by men and women who believe that all of us — not just some, but all — should have the chance to live up to our God-given potential.
Not only because we're a tolerant country, or a generous country, or a compassionate country, but because we're a better, stronger, more prosperous country when we harness the talent, hard work, and ingenuity of every single American.
I wish my mother could have been with us longer. I wish she could have seen Chelsea become a mother herself. I wish she could have met Charlotte.
I wish she could have seen the America we're going to build together.
An America, where if you do your part, you reap the rewards.
Where we don't leave anyone out, or anyone behind.
An America where a father can tell his daughter: yes, you can be anything you want to be. Even President of the United States.
Thank you all. God bless you. And may God bless America.

[applause]
Thank you. Oh, I am thrilled to be here, and to be in such a beautiful facility, having just had the chance to spend a little time with some children, mostly 4-year-olds, but a few 5-year-olds. It was great.
And I thank Julie and the entire team here at the Y. I am such a big believer in this kind of partnership, and I was thrilled, as Julie was talking about it, to see the applause break out on behalf of this YMCA and all that it does.
This is, for me, a very important place to be to talk about a really critical issue, one that, as Julie has said, I have spent much of my adult life being committed to and concerned about, and I can't think of a better place to do this than here in New Hampshire, a state that will always have a special place in my heart. [laughter] [applause]
And so, I had a great event Saturday in a perfect place on a perfect day, on Roosevelt Island in New York City at the Four Freedoms park that was constructed in honor of President Roosevelt. And I was able to talk about the four fights that I want to wage and win on behalf of the American people.
They, to me, really encapsulate what my campaign is about, but also what our country needs to do together, build an economy for tomorrow, not yesterday; strengthen America's families, because when our families are strong, America is strong; harness all of our power, not just the military but diplomatic and economic to use our values to lead the world; and to revitalize our democracy here at home, particularly by focusing on getting dark, unaccountable money out of politics, even if it takes a constitutional amendment. [applause]
And I will be rolling out specific policies over the weeks to come, but I do believe with all my heart that everything we need to do in our country really starts with how we treat our children and how we try to raise them, taking care of their needs, being able to stimulate them, to give them a better chance in life, helping them become successful and good citizens.
And, for me, all of this does come back to our kids. And that's because my mother, who was with me in New Hampshire in 2008, really taught me that everybody needs a chance and everybody needs a champion. And for... [applause]
For her, she knew what it was like not to have either when she was growing up, because she was abandoned very young by her parents and sent to live with grandparents who didn't want her, so that by the time she was 14, she was out on her own, working as a house maid and a babysitter, in another family's home.
And I didn't know any of this when I was growing up. When I was the age of the kids we were reading ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"" to, I just knew she was my mom. And she was great and she was fun, and she taught me so much. And she made grilled cheese and tomato soup sandwiches. I mean, there was just a wonderful sense of being loved and taken care of, but also being inspired.
And I remember asking her when I got old enough to kind of piece together some of the answers to questions I was getting about her childhood, how could she do this?
And her answer was very simple, you know, kindness along the way from people that cared about her and showed her she mattered. The first-grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat for lunch, and without embarrassing here, started bringing extra food, and then would lean over and whisper, ""Dorothy, I brought too much food today. Would you like some? I can't eat it all.""
Or even the woman whose house she went to work in, she wanted so much to go to high school, but she knew she had to do the chores that were necessary. And so the woman said, ""Well, if you can get your chores done, you can go to high school."" And that was a great gift that my mother was forever grateful for.
Because those people believed in her, she believed in me. You know, there is a direct link. If we believe in our children, we instill in them the belief that they are worth something. And then they, in turn, can pass that on.
Now, ideally we all hope that families can do that. But in today's world, it's really hard for many families to do everything they're expected to do under the stresses that they face. Because of her, I believe in the potential of every American, and particularly every American child. And when our children succeed, America succeeds.
So, I've been a champion for early childhood education for as long as I can remember, really starting when I was in law school and got interested in, as I was studying the law, why do some people follow the law and other people don't. What's—what's in their background? What makes them either a productive member of society or somebody on the outside who may be trying to tear down instead of build up?
And that's why I'm putting this front and center in my campaign, because I think it's time we realized once and for all that investing in our children is one of the best investments our country can make. [applause]
Now, I think most of us kind of intuitively have known that. But now research is telling us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact life-long success. So we have to help parents be their children's first teachers, from that very first day. And we have to help them get access to quality, affordable childcare and preschool.
And for me, it's recognizing the reality of today's families: 40 percent of the breadwinners, the principle breadwinners in America today are women. We have a lot of single moms heroically trying to raise kids under sometimes very challenging circumstances. We have a lot of two-parent families where people are working night shifts. They're overlapping. They are just doing everything they can sometimes with multiple jobs to keep body and soul together and put that food on the table and that roof over their head.
Today's parents have to juggle so much. They have to squeeze every minute out of every 24-hour day. And that just makes the argument even stronger as to why we have to have their backs. We have to be there to help them do the best job they can possibly do.
Yes, they need to do the job that pays them. But at the end of the day, the job raising children, taking care of your family, caring even for your parents as they age, is the most important job any of us will ever do. And we don't do it for pay. We do it for love. We do it for a sense of giving back. But let's try to figure out how to make it a little bit easier.
You know, I met a woman... [applause]
You know, I met a woman a few weeks—a couple weeks ago who was trying to do everything she could imagine to make it work. She was a single mom. She's raising three kids. She was working, and she was going to community college, because she was trying to get ahead so that she could get a better job.
She said, ""You know, I don't ask for anything, but why does it have to be so hard""? I hear that question all over. ""Why does it have to be so hard""?
It's hard enough to pay for any preschool or childcare at all, let alone the quality programs that help kids develop and flourish. Funding for these opportunities has not kept up with changing times and rising demand. So it's no surprise that out-of-pocket childcare costs for families have soared by nearly 25 percent the past decade.
In many states, it costs more for childcare of quality than it costs for college tuition, and we know what's happened at that end of the learning curve.
We actually did make a lot of progress expanding preschool attendance for 3-and 4-year-olds during the 1990s. I was honored to hold the first ever White House conference on early childhood development to bring together people, like those you see here. [applause]
But starting in 2001, there's been almost no progress. Only 55 percent of all of America's 3-and 4-year-olds are enrolled in preschool, and meanwhile, many of our economic competitors are racing ahead. They are making big investments in preschool and early education.
I'll tell you a little story. You know, I spent a lot of time as secretary of state trying to figure out how we were going to deal with the rise of China. It's going to be one of the biggest problems for the next president. And there're a lot of aspects to it.
But I was not surprised to get a call about two years ago shortly, after I left the State Department, on behalf of the highest-ranking woman in the Chinese government. And she was coming to Washington, and I had worked with her as secretary of state, and she asked if she could see me, and I said, ""Of course. I'd be happy to see her.""
And then she said, ""You know, could you do an event with me about early childhood""? I said, ""Oh, certainly. What is it about early childhood that has you so interested""?
Here's what she said, and then we did the event. We did the event at the Brookings Institute in Washington.
China's making a huge commitment to early childhood and to pre-kindergarten. Why? They look at the same brain research.
In fact, they have asked the American Nobel Prize-winning economist from the University of Chicago, hardly a hotbed of radical liberalism... [laughter] ... to be their consultant, among others, because he did the study, which proved that early-childhood investing by a country is one of the best returns on investment that we can make. So the Chinese are using an American expert for that. [applause]
Though, if I hadn't been excited before, I got really motivated about this. But unfortunately, we're hearing something different from Republican leaders in Washington.
Republicans aren't just missing the boat on early-childhood education; they're trying to sink it. Their budget puts at risk on the most effective investments for our youngest children, Early Head Start.
Did they cut subsidies to oil companies? No. Did they cut tax loopholes, like carried interest for hedge-fund managers? No.
The Republicans took care of those at the top and went after the kids.
Now I believe getting off to a good start should be our children's birthright, part of the basic bargain that we have with each other as a nation.
Every child should have the tools and the skills to thrive in tomorrow's economy, especially those kids from our most vulnerable and at-risk communities. And we need to make sure that parents can get good jobs and stay in the workforce. That drives the economic engine. So we have to do more to help them deal with the most difficult of the decisions of parents for young children to stay in the workforce.
I believe the time has come to make pre-school and quality child care available to every child in America. If our families are going to be strong and our economy is going to thrive, all our kids need the chance to get off to the best possible start. [applause]
I will I will work with states and communities across America to make sure that in the next 10 years, every four-year-old in America has access to high-quality pre-school. Now already governors and state legislatures across the country are discovering the value of pre-school and this is bipartisan.
You know, one of the states with a universal pre-K program in America is Oklahoma—about as red a state as you can get. But they have figured it out, the government and business leaders and families alike that this is a smart investment for them. And we have to build on the momentum started by the states. Now look how far here in New Hampshire you've come.
Nearly 20 years ago, back when Senator Jeanne Shaheen was Governor Shaheen, she delivered funding for public kindergarten for the first time in the state's history. [applause]
That then allowed the conversation to move where it is today with Governor Maggie Hassan supporting efforts for full-day kindergarten and innovative pre-K partnerships. So you start and get what you... [applause] ... have achieved on kindergarten. Then you move toward full day and then innovative pre-K.
All across the country we need to be doing that. And we also need to invest in child care because, if you only start at four, the brain research shows that 80 percent of your brain has developed by the age of three. Now the good news is that leaves 20 percent to keep working on. [laughter]
But it is a fact that, by three, many of our kids have already had most of the brain development that they're going to get. And in this campaign, I'll offer a comprehensive agenda to ensure that every child in America has access to quality affordable child care. [applause]
I will propose a middle-class tax cut to help parents deal with rising child care costs. [applause]
And I'll lead an effort to expand child care opportunities and to make sure that programs address both the needs of working parents and the needs of children.
We shouldn't think of child care as just a place to deposit your kids, a warehouse. We should invest in programs that create health environments for early learning and to make sure that parents get the support they need from the time their children are infants. I will double the Early Head Start Child Care Partnership Grant Program, which brings Head Start's evidenced-based curriculum into the child care setting to provide comprehensive, full-day, high-quality services to low-income families. And I will double our investment in Early Head Start itself, a program I helped to create when I was first lady. And we know... [applause]
We know it's making a difference, because we actually have evidence that shows it's making a difference.
And this is part, as I said, of a long-term commitment of mine, going back to my Methodist Church, where I was—I was raised, and babysitting, you know, children of Mexican migrant farmworkers, through my years at the Children's Defense Fund, working to expand opportunities for kids with disabilities, and through my time in the White House with my husband and in the Senate in New York and even as secretary of state, because I have learned that talent is universal, but opportunity is not. And I look sometimes... [applause]
I look sometimes in the eyes of kids who've had a really tough set of obstacles to overcome, and they're doing the best they can. And we need to do what we can to help them succeed.
But every baby comes into this world with so much God-given potential. And when they leave the hospital, some will have great opportunity their family can give them, and others will struggle.
Now, as you may have heard, I am a new grandmother. And so, for me... [applause] ... this has become really personal. I remember being in the hospital waiting for Charlotte's arrival and talking to the nurses there. And what did they want to talk to me about? They wanted to talk to me about how hard it was for them, plus a lot of their patients, to get childcare. How it was especially hard when they had to work the night shift. How they has to keep juggling everything, all the time. And it was here, at one of the great moments in my life, a reminder that there are so many hardworking, conscientious people, who deserve more help than they're getting right now.
And it needs to be a partnership, just like this Y is a partnership. You know, a partnership between the public and private interests. A partnership where people feel that they can contribute and participate.
I think if we come together and take this on as a true national mission, we can unlock the potential of all our children and further the potential of our country.
And our country then will be more inclusive, not leaving people behind and out, and where a father can tell his daughter, ""You can grow up to be anything you want, including president of the United States."" [applause]
QUESTION: Well, how do you do? How do you do?
I'm Jackie Cowell , and like many of you I'm looking around the audience and I'm seeing many of you that like me have been working on this for 20 or 30 years. So thank you for your perseverance on early childhood education out there, you know.
And the children that you met this morning are likely to graduate from high school in 2030. So just think about what 2030 is going to be looking like.
When I was in high school, our class took a field trip to see a computer. I don't... [laughter] ... I don't think they do that anymore, but... [laughter] ... but it's really going to be—they're likely to retire in the 2080s. So how do you prepare them for this very complex world they're going to inherit? And many of them will hold jobs that haven't been invented yet. So it's really working on these skills, as you talked about—early childhood education. And we're thrilled that this discourse is now part of the presidential primary; that early childhood education is being talked about; and making sure ever child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.
And, you know, here in New Hampshire, things have been tough for families, trying to make ends meet, trying to make sure they can get into childcare that is quality, that really helps them reach their full potential. And there's too many families that aren't able to do that because of the difference of the cost.
So, yeah.
CLINTON: Well, you know, Jackie , I think that's a great perspective to put on it because when we talk about early childhood, we think about the little kids like the ones that we were with in the classroom.
But we ought to have a broader perspective and think about the adults they will become. And what kind of adults do we need? We need people who will have exactly the skills for jobs that haven't been invented, and will have the temperament and the character and the attributes to, you know, get along with people, to respect the law, respect each other, to be part of building a stronger, more prosperous America.
And I think it's a great perspective if you kind of work backwards and you say to yourself, ""OK, what are you going to look for in somebody who wants to be a worker and a citizen in 15, 20, 30 years?"" You know that that really starts so importantly at the beginning.
QUESTION: Thank you so much for being here this morning and for this discussion.
I'm Mary Lou Beaver from Rochester. I'm not here this morning representing an organization, but as someone who was in the field for more than 25 years as a teacher, as a center director, and as a center owner here in Rochester.
I also was a mom, who was dependent upon childcare for my children as I suddenly found myself a single mom, and was in school trying to continue my education so that I could do more and provide more for my family. Having quality childcare education, early education for my kids was so important to me because I was in and out so much of the time when I really wanted to be spending time with them, and wanted to give them all that I could.
But as so many parents today are facing, you need to work the hours that you have to work in order to support your family. And it's very important that we have not only the accessibility and the quality, but the affordability for all families.
Do you agree?
CLINTON: Oh, I do agree. And I think your story is really important for everybody to hear because that is the reality that is going on right now. I—I just meet so many working parents, particularly single working moms who are struggling. They're really working as hard as they can, as you were, and many of them trying to go to school at the same time because they know they'll have a better future if they do.
I remember when I was teaching law at the University of Arkansas, oh gosh, back in the early 1970s, I met so many people around the campus who were single parents, trying to go to school. And childcare was their biggest obstacle. And we, you know, we started a fund called the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund, because it wasn't the money that they needed so much for the tuition, although that was a stretch, it was all the other expenses that surrounded the difficulty of them being able to get their education.
And I think you have to look at what young families are going through today in a very comprehensive way and say, OK, what can the extended family do? What can the—you know, houses of worship, our churches, do? What can communities do? What can the Y do? Or you know, the Boys & Girls Club?
There's so many different ways to kind of piece this together, but there isn't any way to get to a universal program, unless our government in Washington sees it as a priority to partner with many of the states and localities—we have the mayor here; thank you for being here, mayor—so that we can provide the backstop and the support that is necessary.
And it's particularly important for the youngest kids, the zero to three kids, because those are kids who need a lot more personal attention. You know, Bill and I are exhausted every time we take care of Charlotte. [laughter]
We love every minute of it, but whew. It reminds you hard it is to raise babies and to keep an eye on them, as they, you know, take off on their own. So I think it is important that we do everything we can to deal with that zero-to-three age group. And that's going to take more direction. That's why I mentioned Early Head Start Child Care Partnership and the Early Head Start Program.
But again, we need more people to help fill that space because that's often where parents really are stretched, and we also don't have a lot of time off for a lot of working parents And so, just getting everything organized, when you have that new baby is a challenge, don't you think?
QUESTION: Absolutely. As a grandmother, I can certainly relate to the exhaustion. [laughter] The other concern that I had as a center director was the wages that we were able to pay to our educators. We know that consistent, quality educators are so important to young children, as they are growing and learning. But we can't always keep them, because of the wages that are paid.
CLINTON: Well, that's why I said I'm going to offer a middle-class tax cut that can go toward helping parents pay for quality child care, because you've put your finger on one the biggest problems. A lot of parents cannot afford quality child care. And a lot of the teachers and the child care workers can't afford to live on what the parents can pay.
So you have a perfect storm where we need quality child care, but how are we going to get the people with the continuity so that the experience is there to be able to deliver that child care. When parents can't go any further, they're stretched as far as they can get.
And I have been meeting with child care workers. And a lot of them just throw up their hands. They'd rather go be a food server for the money, but not for the, you know, reward that they have gotten from taking care of kids. They just—I mean, they're making $8, $9, $10 an hour for often 12-hour days. And that is just a huge burden on them and their family. So then, you have a downward spiral. Is that what you've seen, too?
QUESTION: It is. There's a saying that: Parent's can't afford to pay; teachers can't afford to stay; there's got to be a better way. And so...
UNKNOWN: That's good.
QUESTION: Right—it's the Worthy Wage Campaign, is—that's their saying.
And so here in New Hampshire, we've actually with the Department of Education, Department of Health and Human Services and our governor's office applied for two federal grants, hoping to really show what we could do in early childhood education. So the Race to the Top—Early Learning Challenge Grant and the Preschool Development Grant, and we didn't get them. And one of the reasons, we're the only New England state that didn't get the Race to the Top Grant, because we've been divesting instead of investing.
And so what we found also, talking with business leaders, that this is not a red or a blue issue, that people really genuinely care about making sure every child has that opportunity.
So here in New Hampshire, we're really seeing that starting to—to come—but we haven't gotten those grants, and we'd like to.
CLINTON: Well, I want to throw it open for—I know there're a lot of people in this audience who care deeply about this issue, have their own experience in doing the issue.
And so Julia, I think we should see if somebody else wants to contribute to the conversation.
MODERATOR: Do we have any questions from the audience? Right here in the pattern?
QUESTION: Hi.
CLINTON: There is—there is...
MODERATOR: There is a microphone coming.
CLINTON: There's a roving microphone. [laughter]
QUESTION: Oh. Thank you.
My daughter—my granddaughter is here. What are you going to do for the—the grandparents that are raising these children? My generation, all of my friends are raising their grandchildren.
CLINTON: Can I ask you without—I don't want to impinge on your—your privacy. What are the circumstances under which you're raising your grandchildren [inaudible]?
QUESTION: It was—[inaudible]—they're going to be turned over to the state because of addiction.
CLINTON: So, you know, I have to tell you, this is—thank you. Thank you. I'm so, so sorry. But you are the second grandmother in New Hampshire who's said that to me.
And that's one of the reasons why if you followed my campaign—because of what I've been hearing, because I have spent two months listening to people, because I do think it's important, when you want to represent the entire country, you actually listen to what's happening in people's lives. And substance abuse and addiction is ravaging families all over the country.
And I heard it first in Iowa and then as soon as I got to New Hampshire—I was sitting down in Keene, New Hampshire talking to some people. First thing a retired doctor said, ""What are you going to do about the heroin epidemic in New Hampshire""?
First of all, I'm going to talk a lot about it, because we need to drag it out of shadows. We need to hold it up to the light. [applause]
And—and—and then it's heartbreaking, because there has not been an event I've got to, where somebody hasn't come up to me, sometimes bravely, like you did in public, and sometimes just privately taking me aside to talk to me about it.
That and mental-health problems that go untreated and... [applause]
So I would say three things.
First, I think you're very brave and very loving to take on this responsibility, and you should know that every time... [applause] ... you think about how hard it is, and you're grandchildren will be really better off because their grandmother stepped in and said, ""I'm here for you, and I will take care of you."" [applause]
Secondly, we have to—we have to extend every program, every tax—everything we do to people taking care of kids, whether they are parents or they are grandparents or maybe, in some cases, older siblings or aunts or uncles, because of the inability of a child's parents to be able to do so.
So whatever I propose, you will be eligible for, people who are taking care of their grandchildren. [applause]
Yes. Yes. [applause]
Right now, you can't get any help in most places. And we have to change that. We have to face the reality. I mean, when you're—look, I just --we were just laughing about, you know, my eight-month old is beginning, you know, heave herself around in the resemblance of a crawl. But once she takes off and we're chasing her around, and trying to keep her hands out of the outlets and all the things that you have to do with little kids, grandparents who are raising their kids, and there are millions of them, need more help.
You know, when I was a senator, I championed a program in New York City to have a special form of housing for grandmothers raising their kids, because they needed, in my view, the support of a community. Because it can be really isolating. I mean, most of your friends, you know, they're not raising babies, toddlers or school-age kids, so you need the support of a broader community to help you with that, and you need the support that any parent would get, because that's what you're doing, you're parenting.
So I can tell you that I will do everything I can, both in any benefit that I think the country should extend to raising children, you will be eligible, but also to the idea of how do we provide support for you and for other grandmothers, because it's predominantly grandmothers. There are some grandfathers, predominantly grandmothers too.
QUESTION: [off-mike]
CLINTON: It is.
QUESTION: [off-mike]
CLINTON: You have half-a-dozen friends?
QUESTION: Well, yeah.
CLINTON: No, no, I mean who are raising their children. [laughter]
Yeah.
QUESTION: They're raising... [crosstalk]
CLINTON: And do you support each other?
QUESTION: Oh, absolutely.
CLINTON: OK. That's—that's important. You need to support each other because you need to get that, you know, that emotional support and the—and the—and the hints and the tips, like, you know, somebody finds out something that'll work for them, it may work for you.
So thank you for raising that and thank you for saying that. Yeah.
Julie?
MODERATOR: Thank you.
Next question. Over here? Sure.
QUESTION: Hi. Early childhood education is a great foundation, but I have a 14 year old, so what your plans for education in general? The state of education today is horrendous, especially for children with ADHD. You're looking at cookie-cutter classrooms, and these kids don't learn that way.
So what types of plans do you have for them?
CLINTON: Well, this is one of the—you know, the key issues about how we do more do adapt our school system to spark the ability to learn in every kind of kid, because kids learn differently.
You know, some kids can sit there and absorb the teacher's lessons. Some kids need to move. Some kids need to have practical experience. And I do think we have erred in trying to channel every kid into one form of learning. And I don't think that... [applause]
I don't think that works for every kid. And especially for kids who are hyperactive, kids who, you know, need to be channeled and directed, but also need to be able to, you know, get rid of some of that extra energy that they've got.
I mean, I don't know how you—I don't know how you expect to eliminate everything from recess to gym to extracurricular activities during the school day and not have a lot of kids unable to concentrate and a lot of kids unable to really absorb the lessons you're trying to teach.
So, the specific issue about ADHD kids is we need to make sure we have the best possible diagnosis and treatment, because we are medicating lots of kids. And I think we have to ask ourselves: Are we medicating those kids because they have a medical condition that needs to be medicated? And the answer is yes, some do, no doubt about it. But are we medicating kids because we've not yet figured out how to better deal with their particular needs?
And that starts in the family, because it, you know, it's hard for a lot of families, but it also goes into the schools.
So I—I—part of what I will be talking about in the campaign is how do we, you know, get our schools and doing so by respecting our teachers who are on the front lines of trying to... [applause] ... help kids. And, you know, trying to figure out what works for different kinds of kids. And I don't think a cookie-cutter approach works. I want every kid to do well in school. I want every kid to get the skills that that kid needs. I think we made an error when we eliminated in high school, in most high schools, technical education, what we used to call vocational education. [applause]
I think, you know, there are—we're going to need a lot of jobs that are good jobs, by people who can do work that is not just academic work. It is work that, you know, they learn to do by doing. And then—I was, you know, I was in a community college, you knew, New Hampshire Technical Institute, talking to the people there. And the—there were students who were taking courses, who were in high school. That's one way of doing it, having kind of a group of high schools send their kids to a technical institute if they're interested.
I went to one in Iowa where young kids were learning how to be machinists. They were juniors and seniors in high school. And the ones who were seniors had jobs lined up, starting to pay, like, $40,000 because they were coming out as a certified machinist.
Well, we need to make that available for more kids. And, look, I'm not a scientist. [laughter]
But unlike a lot of the candidates on the other side, I actually listen to scientists. [laughter]
And one of the things that... [laughter and applause] ... one of the things that I will try to do, with a—by partnering, you know, not by mandating and directing, but partnering with our educators, partnering with people who have experience like our folks here, is to figure out: OK, how do we get more hands-on learning? Because I do believe that for kids, especially ADHD kids, doing something, not trying to sit still, which is really hard, but getting up and learning, you know, going from machine to machine to figure out how it works, if that's their interest.
So we're going to take a hard look at all of that. But it's—you know, education is a local and state matter, but I think if we do a better job looking at all the research about what actually produces the best results, then we can come up with some incentive programs and some encouragement that will begin to try once again to get our education system to respond to the real needs that a whole variety of kids have.
QUESTION: Thank you. [applause]
MODERATOR: Can we get someone in the back? Women in the [inaudible]? Yes.
Here comes the mike.
QUESTION: Thank you. We spend so much money on the military and we are able to get the money just like this. But nationwide, our schools are not equal and they're not of the same standards. So, why are we not making a priority nationwide and per state on education as much as spending on other things? And the military is important, I do realize that.
OK. Thank you.
CLINTON: Well, you know, education has been principally a state responsibility and a local responsibility. And it really wasn't until, you know, 30, 40 years ago, really, I guess back in the 1960s, when the government began to put in a lot more money from the Federal Government into education.
And the original idea behind the Federal Government putting money in was to try to equalize spending, so that, you know, kids in poor districts would have a better chance to get the same resources and the same quality of teachers and all that, which I think is still very important, so that it was an equity argument—some of you know, Title 1, in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act—was really designed to do that.
Then in the Reagan Administration, I think it was 19—I want to remember here—'83 or so. There was a report that came out called ""A Nation at Risk."" And it compared our educational outcomes with comparable countries, mostly Europeans, some Asian, and basically said, you know, our kids are not keeping up, they're not performing. And that was really a big change.
The Reagan administration began saying, OK, well, the Federal Government has to do more to try to change the way we're educating. And that went on. And certainly, President George W. Bush with No Child Left Behind, it was certainly well-motivated. I was in the Senate. I know the arguments that were made. And it was to try to, you know, create a system where, no matter who you were, where you went to school, you'd have the same expectations about how you were going to achieve.
And I say all of this because we've always spent money on our military, you know, depending upon who's in and who's out, greater or lesser amounts. But always the biggest part of the budget, other than Social Security, Medicare, et cetera.
So I think that your question is a fair one, like, what are our priorities? We will always have to have the—you know, the strongest, best-equipped military. But even there we have to save money. We have to be smart about it. We have to look for ways to get more done efficiently.
And just like every other part of government, it needs to be looked at hard, so that we don't just send money, without getting the results that we need. And there are a lot of issues in procurement and in other areas around—you know, military equipment and expenditures that really need to be cleaned up, streamlined and made less expensive without sacrificing quality.
So I think that it's time in our country—and in my speech on Saturday, I said we have to [inaudible] our government. We have to take a hard look at everything. We have to bring it into the 21st century. Now our military equipment is 22nd century. I mean, it's more advanced than anybody, anywhere.
But we're also fighting wars where a lot of what we've paid a lot of money for is no longer applicable. I mean, we're dealing with different kinds of threats. We're dealing with cyber threats. We're dealing with, you know, irregular warfare and terrorism. So we've got to adjust how we fund even defense, but we have to always fund it. to the extend that we need to get the outcomes we're looking for.
But on education, we've put more federal dollars in. But to go back to the question about ADHD, we need to take a hard look about what's working and what's not working. I just want to give you a—and I'm going to roll out a whole education proposal, too. But I want to give you a quick understanding of what I mean.
You know, everybody believes, and I'm guilty of this, that we're an expert about education, because we went to school. [laughter]
And those of us who are parents, we had kids in school, so we think we got it all figured out. We know what worked or didn't work for us and, therefore, we kind of translate that into what will or won't work for other people.
Look, there's a lot of truth to that. People's—your experience matters. And how you experienced school matters.
But I think research really counts. So, there's a team of researchers I know—you know, they're based at Harvard, but other schools have been involved. And they went through all of the work that's been done. They said, OK, what makes for a great school?
And they came out with some things that are simple, but hard to do and hard to pay for, you know, things like a longer school year, particularly for disadvantaged kids. We have so much research, it matters, because, you know, for many of this in room, summertime, you give your kids new experiences. Maybe they go to the Y camp. I was talking to, you know, one of he people where who runs the camps. Maybe they—maybe you take them on trips, where they go to museums.
But for a lot of kids, they actually lose learning over the summer. So here the teachers have worked and worked, and parents have reinforced the messages in many instances, then they lose ground, so they start the school year a little behind in some areas than where they ended the school year.
So a longer school year for a lot of kids makes a lot of sense. A longer school day for a lot of kids makes a lot of sense, because if you have kids particularly in the pre-teen, early-teen years, and they get out of school before parents get home from work, that is one of the worst times of the day for kids to get themselves in trouble. And all kinds of trouble and bad influences.
Well, you know, the parents are working. Oftentimes, again, they have no options, so longer day, longer school day.
More support for preparing for teachers so that they can share what works with each other. Now, that sounds so simple, but it is so critical. Like, OK, what worked in your classroom? You know, I tried this lesson, it didn't work, let's take another look at it.
And what we've done instead is to disempower experienced teachers and instead basically try to lay on top of them all of these tests and all of these standards.
I believe in both, always have, but you can get to a point of diminishing returns. Too many and really all you're doing is like running on the hamster wheel, instead of figuring out what does this kid need? What's the diagnosis for this kid's problem? How do we deal with it? And then finally let's not forget the role that parents play and families play in helping a kid succeed in school. So having more interaction between the school and the home, even if it's a phone call, even if it's an e-mail exchange, even better if it's regular visits. Because if parents don't understand what their kids are supposed to be learning and they don't reinforce it, it's really hard for teachers to make that case.
So I think that we can do a better job in using the money we spend on education more effectively and trying to figure out where at state and local levels more expenditures would make a difference. And I'm very open to that because it breaks my heart that in a lot of poor districts right now, those poor schools have lost every extracurricular activity. They don't have sports teams anymore. They don't have bands. They don't have plays. They don't have a lot of the things that you remember from school and that for many kids gave them their first taste of success.
And so, when you cut out all of those programs and you just say, ""You've got to do well on these tests"" that are taught in a certain way, to be learned in a certain way, a lot of kids are not gonna be able to grasp that and do well. But if you give them more options, more responsibility and more support for those places that need it, then, I think, we can get better outcomes personally as well as academically.
So that's what I want to see us do more of, so. [applause]
QUESTION: Thank you.
MODERATOR: Thank you.
We have time for one more question. Lady in the back in the polka dot?
QUESTION: Thank you for mentioning that you listen to scientists, because I happen to be one of them. [laughter]
CLINTON: Excellent. [laughter]
QUESTION: So I'm a mom, and [inaudible] that way, but also I am a research psychologist, and studying creativity and studying social-emotional learning, especially in schools.
And one thing that you mentioned also was that we want to prepare kids, and I completely agree with you, for the jobs of tomorrow that we don't know what they're going to be. We don't know what they are going to be, and the central skill that we need to teach them and enable is creativity.
However, we seem to also do one more thing is compare ourselves to places like China. And our education is turning into worksheet-based education. Only we are drilling kids and art is disappearing, music is disappearing, even in [inaudible] rich schools where I live in Portsmouth. Art is once a week. Music is once a week. That's it.
And it's all about tests and it's all about [inaudible] even in kindergarten. I have heard stories from kindergartners who come home crying after tests in kindergarten.
So, can we try to compare ourselves also to places like Finland that do not start formal education until age seven? [applause]
They let them play. [applause]
CLINTON: Well, you make a great point. If people are really interested in following up on the points that she made, we don't compare ourselves to China, but it is stressing to me when China invests in preschool opportunities for kids and we don't. Because if you look at the highest-performing nations, Finland is usually at the top.
They have early childhood education. They have paid leave. They have support for families. And yes, they don't start school until kids are seven, but those kids have not just been wandering around fending for themselves. They've been in organized settings, predominantly family-based, but not exclusively.
And if you look at the other countries—the best comparisons are to what are called the OECD countries, if you're interested in googling that and looking. They do a very thorough educational survey every few years and they lay out what's working and what's not working.
And I absolutely agree that, you know, creativity, you cannot expect kids to be creative if you don't let them play. Now, playing is a learning experience and in preschool it should be, in kindergarten it should be. [applause]
That doesn't mean they can't be learning at the same time. And that—and this debate that we're having seems to me to be so beside the point. It's not like either play or learn. Through play that is supervised in preschool, you will learn if it's done right. That's why we want quality preschool. Right? And so it's a way of unleashing creativity and allowing, you know, little kids' personalities to develop.
I just—in the classroom where I just was, I was handed this book of drawings. Each of the kids did a drawing about what they want to be when they grow up. And, you know, they want to be a firefighter. They want to be an artist. They want to be a vet. They want to be a hair stylist. I mean, it was everything you could imagine, but that's the beginning of them thinking about envisioning adulthood.
So the teachers here, they look at that, and they—and they—you know, they'll talk about what it would mean to be a vet. Or gee, why do you want to be a hair stylist? What does that mean to you? What kind of artist do you want to be? That is just as important as anything else you can do in the classroom.
And so I think that the reaction against all the testing is coming from people who believe that we have to—we have to hold accountable what happens in our school. We can't just say it doesn't matter whether kids learn anything. That's not acceptable.
But we have to get back to thinking about the different ways kids learn, and creativity—the best gift you can give a child is a creative, open, learning mind that will enable that child to pursue his or her own dreams to live up to his or her own God-given potential.
And that potential may... [applause] ... may not at all be the same by anybody else's.
So I want to—I want to give our two guests, if I can, the chance for the last word, because they—they've been on the front lines.
UNKNOWN: Thanks, Secretary.
You know, we're just delighted again that this is part of a discourse in the presidential campaign, having early childhood education. And it really is in those earliest years—more than numeracy and literacy, it's those essential life skills, like you mentioned, perseverance, working in teams, ability to problem-solve, creativity that can make all the difference in preparing them for their future.
Thank you.
Thank you so much for this conversation. [applause]
Jackie and I were talking earlier with so many in the room that have been down in the trenches with us for the last 25 or more years that we've been doing this in New Hampshire.
And it is so wonderful to have this discussion today that we are having and to have so many people know what early childhood is, know what it means, to have seen that brain development going through from zero to age five and understand the importance of this.
And we are so welcome to have this piece. Thank you. [applause]
So that concludes our program today, and I just wanted to thank you all very much for coming out to the YMCA of Strafford County and thank Secretary Clinton. [applause]

But her lunch on Tuesday could be a little bit awkward, thanks to one man, Senator Bernie Sanders, who's been giving Clinton a run for her money on the trail with his huge crowds and his populist message.
But when she sat down with CNN's Brianna Keilar for her first national TV interview, Clinton insisted there's no bad blood.
CLINTON: Well, first of all, I always thought this would be a competitive race.
So, I am happy to have a chance to get out and run my campaign as I see fit and let other candidates do exactly the same. I feel very good about where we are in Iowa. We are signing up thousands of volunteers, people committed to caucus for us. We have a committed supporter in every one of the 1,600 precincts.
And one of the things that I learned last time is, it's organize, organize, organize. So I couldn't be happier about my campaign.
KEILAR: Senator Sanders has talked about how, if he's president, he would raise taxes. In fact, he said to CNN's Jake Tapper, he would raise them substantially higher than they are today, on big corporations, on wealthy Americans.
Would you?
CLINTON: Well, I will be laying out my own economic policies. Again, everybody has to run his or her own campaign. And I'm going to be telling the American people what I propose and how I think it will work. And then we'll let voters make up their minds.
KEILAR: Are—is raising taxes on the table?
CLINTON: I'm going to put out my policies, and I'll other people speak to their policies, because I think we have to both grow the economy faster and fairer, so we have to do what will actually work in the short term, the medium term and the long term.
I will be making a speech about my economic proposals on Monday. And then I look forward to the debate about them.
KEILAR: We see in our recent poll that nearly six in 10 Americans say they don't believe that you're honest and trustworthy. Do you see any role that you've had in the sentiment that we've seen, where people are questioning whether you're trustworthy?
CLINTON: I can only tell you, Brianna, that this has been a theme that has been used against me and my husband for many, many years. And, at the end of the day, I think voters sort it all out. I have great confidence. I trust the American voter.
KEILAR: One of the issues that has eroded some trust that we've seen is the issue of your e-mail practices while you were secretary of state. I think there's a lot of people who don't understand what your thought process was on that.
So, can you tell me the story of how you decided to delete 33,000 e-mails and how that deletion was executed?
CLINTON: Well, let's start from the beginning. Everything I did was permitted. There was no law, there was no regulation, there was nothing that did not give me the full authority to decide how I was going to communicate.
Previous secretaries of state have said they did the same thing. And people across the government knew that I used one device. Maybe it was because I am not the most technically capable person and wanted to make it as easy as possible.
KEILAR: But you said they—that they did the same thing, that they used a personal server and...
CLINTON: Well, personal e-mail.
KEILAR: ... when facing a subpoena, deleted e-mails from them?
CLINTON: You know, you're starting with so many assumptions that are—I've never had a subpoena. There is nothing—again, let's take a deep breath here. Everything I did was permitted by law and regulation. I had one device.
When I mailed anybody in the government, it would go into the government system. Now, I didn't have to turn over anything. I chose to turn over 55,000 pages, because I wanted to go above and beyond what was expected of me, because I knew the vast majority of everything that was official already was in the State Department system.
KEILAR: Let's talk now about Republicans. There are so many. [laughter]
But, right now, the front-runner... [laughter]
CLINTON: It's a big crew.
KEILAR: It is a big crew.
Right now, the front-runner is Jeb Bush. Can you believe that a quarter-century after your husband was elected, there could be another Bush-Clinton race?
CLINTON: Well, we'll see.
That's up to, first, the Republicans on his side and the Democrats on my side. What's great about America is anybody can run for president. That is literally true. And you have to go out and you have to do what everybody else does. You have to make your case. You have to have your agenda. You have to raise the money. You have to work really hard.
KEILAR: Donald Trump is also creating quite a lot of commotion on the other side. He's a friend of yours, has been over the years. He donated to your Senate campaign, to the Clinton Foundation.
What's your reaction to his recent comments that some Mexican immigrants are rapists and criminals?
CLINTON: I'm very disappointed in those comments.
And I—I feel very bad and very disappointed with him and with the Republican Party for not responding immediately and saying: Enough. Stop it. But they are all in the—you know, in the same general area on immigration.
You know, they don't want to provide a path to citizenship. They range across a spectrum of being either grudgingly welcome or hostile toward immigrants.
KEILAR: But what about Jeb Bush's approach to that? It's different, certainly, than Donald Trump's and...
[crosstalk]
CLINTON: Well, he doesn't—he doesn't believe in a path to citizenship. If he did at one time, he no longer does.
KEILAR: Have you given any thought to the woman who should be on the $10 bill? [laughter]
CLINTON: You know, I am very torn about it. I want a woman on a bill. I don't know why they picked the $10 bill. Some people are now agitating for the $20 bill.
KEILAR: The $20. Do you think it should be the $20?
CLINTON: You know, I want a woman on the bill. And I think that it might be easier to change the $20 than it is to change the $10. But we'll see.
And I don't like the idea that, as a compromise, you would basically have two people on the same bill. One would be a woman. That sounds pretty second-class to me. So, I think a woman should have her own bill. And it may be more—more appropriate to look at the $20 than the $10. I don't know. We'll see.
KEILAR: Secretary Clinton, thank you so much for talking with us.
CLINTON: Thank you. My pleasure. Thanks.

Thank you so much. Thank you very much, President Van Zant, and thanks to everyone at the New School for welcoming us today. I'm delighted to be back.
You know, over the past few months, I have had the opportunity to listen to Americans' concerns about an economy that still isn't delivering for them. It's not delivering the way that it should. It still seems, to most Americans that I have spoken with, that it is stacked for those at the top.
But I've also heard about the hopes that people have for their future—going to college without drowning in debt; starting that small business they've always dreamed about; getting a job that pays well enough to support a family and provide for a secure retirement.
Previous generations of Americans built the greatest economy and strongest middle class the world has ever known on the promise of a basic bargain: if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead. And when you get ahead, America gets ahead. But over the past several decades, that bargain has eroded. Our job is to make it strong again.
For 35 years, Republicans have argued that if we give more wealth to those at top by cutting their taxes and letting big corporations write their own rules, it will trickle down, it will trickle down to everyone else. Yet every time they have a chance to try that approach, it explodes the national debt, concentrates wealth even more and does practically nothing to help hard-working Americans.
Twice now in the past 20 years, a Democratic president has had to come in and clean up the mess left behind. [applause]
I think the results speak for themselves. Under President Clinton—I like the sound of that—America saw the longest peacetime expansion in our history. [applause]
Nearly 23 million jobs, a balanced budget and a surplus for the future, and most importantly, incomes rose across the board, not just for those already at the top. Eight years later, President Obama and the American people's hard work pulled us back from the brink of depression. President Obama saved the auto industry, imposed new rules on Wall Street and provided health care to 16 million Americans. [applause]
Now today—today, as the shadow of crisis recedes and longer-term challenges come into focus, I believe we have to build a growth and fairness economy. You can't have one without the other.  We can't create enough jobs and new businesses without more growth, and we can't build strong families and support our consumer economy without more fairness. We need both.
Because while America standing again, we are not yet running the way we should. Corporate profits are at near record highs and Americans are working as hard as ever. But paychecks had nearly budged in real terms. Families today are stretched in so many directions, and so are their budgets. Out of pocket costs of health care, child care, hearing for aging parents, are rising a lot faster than wages.
I hear this everywhere I go. A single mom talked about juggling a job and classes at community college while raising three kids. She doesn't expect anything to come easy. But if she got a raise, everything would not be quite so hard.
The grandmother who works around the clock providing child care to other people's kids. She's proud of her work, but the pay is fairly enough to live on, especially with the soaring price of her prescription drugs.
The young entrepreneur whose dream of buying a bowling alley where he worked as a teenager was nearly derailed by his student debt. If he can grow his business, he can pay off his debt and pay his employees, including himself, more, too.
Millions of hardworking Americans tell similar stories. Wages need to rise to keep up with cost, paychecks need to grow. Families who work hard and do their part deserve to get ahead and stay ahead. The defining economic challenge of our time clear. We must raise incomes for hard-working Americans, so they can afford a middle-class life. We must drive steady income growth that lifts up families, and lifts up our country. And that... [applause]
And that will be my mission, from the first day I am president to the last. I... [applause]
I will get up every day thinking about the families of America, like the family I came from, with a hard-working dad who started a small business and scrimped, and saved, and gave us a good middle-class life. I will be thinking about all the people that I represented in New York and the stories that they told me, and that I worked with them to improve. I will, as your president take on this challenge against the backdrop of major changes in our economy and the global economy that did not start with the Recession and will not end with the recovery.
You know, advances in technology and expanding global trade have created new areas of commercial activity and opened new markets for our exports. Too often they are polarizing our economy, benefiting high skilled workers, but displacing and downgrading blue-collar jobs and other mid-level jobs that used to provide solid incomes for millions of Americans.
Today's marketplace focuses too much on the short-term, like second to second financial trading, and quarterly earnings reports, and too little on long-term investments. Meanwhile, many Americans are making extra money renting out a small room, designing websites, selling products they design themselves at home, or even driving their own car. This on-demand, or so-called gig economy is creating exciting economies and unleashing innovation.
But it is also raising hard questions about work-place protections and what a good job will look like in the future.
So, all of these trends are real and none, none is going away. But they do not determine our destiny. The choices we make as a nation matter.  And the choices we make in the years ahead will set the stage for what American life in the middle class and our economy will be like in this century.
As president, I will work with every possible partner to turn the tide to make these currents of change start working for us more than against us, to strengthen, not hollow out, the American middle class. Because I think at our best, that's what Americans do. We are problem solvers, not deniers. We don't hide from change; we harness it.
The measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hardworking families, not just for successful CEOs and money managers and not some just arbitrary growth targets untethered to people's lives and livelihoods. [applause]
I want to see our economy work for the struggling, the striving and the successful. We're not going to find all the answers we need today in the playbooks of the past, we can't go back to the old policies that failed us before, nor can we just replay the successes.
Today is not 1993. It's not 2009. So we need solutions for the big challenges we face now.
So today, I'm proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hardworking Americans, an agenda for strong growth, fair growth and long-term growth.
Let me begin with strong growth. More growth means more jobs and more new businesses. More jobs give people choices about where to work.
And employers have to offer higher wages and better benefits in order to compete with each other to hire new workers and keep the productive ones. That's why economists tell us that getting closer to full employment is crucial for raising incomes.
Small businesses create more than 60 percent of new American jobs on net, so they have to be a top priority. I've said I want to be the small-business president, and I mean it. And throughout this campaign, I'm going to be talking about how we empower entrepreneurs with less red tape, easier access to capital, tax relief and simplification.
I'll also push for broader business tax reform to spur investment in America, closing those loopholes that reward companies for sending jobs and profits overseas. [applause]
And I know it's not always how we think about this, but another engine of strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform. [applause]
I want you to hear this. Bringing millions of hardworking people into the formal economy would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion over 10 years. [applause]
Then there are the new public investments that will help establish businesses and entrepreneurs, create the next generation of high-paying jobs.
You know, when we get Americans moving, we get our country moving. So let's establish an infrastructure bank that can channel more public and private funds... [applause] ... channel those funds to finance world-class airports, railways, roads, bridges and ports. [applause]
And let's built those faster broadband networks and make sure there's a greater diversity of providers so consumers have more choice. [applause]
And really, there's no excuse not to make greater investments in cleaner renewable energy right now. [applause]
Our economy obviously runs on energy, and the time has come to make America the clean-energy superpower.  I advocate that because these investments will create millions of jobs, save us money in the long run and help us meet the threats of climate change.
And let's fund the scientific and medical research that spawns innovative companies and creates entire new industries, just as the project to sequence the human genome did in the 1990s and President Obama's initiatives on precision medicine and brain research will do in the coming years.
I will set ambitious goals in all of these areas in the months ahead.
But today, let me emphasize another key ingredient of strong growth that often goes overlooked and undervalued: breaking down barriers so more Americans participate more fully in the workforce, especially women. [applause]
We are in a global competition, as I'm sure you have noticed. And we cant afford to leave talent on the sidelines. But that's exactly what we're doing today. When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our future.
The movement of women into the American workforce over the past 40 years was responsible for more than $3.5 trillion in economic growth. But that progress has stalled.
The United States used to rank 7th out of 24 advanced countries in women's labor force participation. By 2013, we had dropped to 19th. That represents a lot of unused potential for our economy and for American families.
Studies show that nearly a third of this decline relative to other countries is because they're expanding family-friendly policies like paid leave and we are not.
We should be making it easier for Americans to be both good workers and good parents and caregivers. Women who want to work should be able to do so without worrying every day about how they're going to take care of their children or what will happen if a family member gets sick.
You know, last year— [applause] —last year while I was at the hospital here in Manhattan, waiting for little Charlotte to make her grand entrance, one of the nurses said, thank you for fighting for paid leave. And we began to talk about it. She sees firsthand what it means for herself and her colleagues as well as for the working parents that she helps take care of.
It's time to recognize that quality, affordable childcare is not a luxury. It's a growth strategy. And it's way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job and women of color making even less. [applause]
You know, all this lost money adds up. And for some women, it's thousands of dollars every year. Now I am well aware that for far too long these challenges have been dismissed by some as women's issues. Well, those days are over. [applause]
Fair pay and fair scheduling, paid family leave and earned sick days, childcare are essential to our competitiveness and our growth. And we can do this in a way that doesn't impose unfair burdens on businesses, especially small businesses.  As president, I'll fight to put families first, just like I have my entire career. [applause]
Now beyond strong growth, we also need fair growth and that will be the second key driver of raising incomes.  The evidence is in. Inequality is a drag on our entire economy. So this is the problem we need to tackle. Now, you may have heard Governor Bush say Americans just need to work longer hours. Well, he must not have met very many American workers. [applause]
Let him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day, or the teacher who in that classroom or the trucker who drives all night. Let him tell that to the fast worker marching in the streets for better pay. They do not need a lecture. They need a raise. [applause]
The truth is the current rules for our economy do reward some work, like financial trading, for example much more than other work, like actually building and selling things, the work that has always been the backbone of our economy. To get all incomes rising again, we need to strike a better balance. If you work hard, you ought to be a fairly. So, we do have to raise the minimum wage, and implement President Obama's new rules on overtime, and then we have to go further. [applause]
I will crack down on bosses who exploit employees by mis-classifying them as contractors or even steal their wages. To make paychecks stretch, we need to take on the major strains on family budgets. I will protect the Affordable Care Act and build on it to lower out-of-pocket health care costs. [applause]
And to make prescription drugs more affordable. We will help families look forward to retirement by defending and enhancing Social Security and making it easier to save for the future. Now, many of these proposals are time-tested and more than a little battle scarred. We need new ideas, as well, and one I believe in and will fight for is profit-sharing. Hard-working Americans deserve to benefit from the record corporate earnings they help produce.
So, I will produce ways to encourage companies to share profits with their employees. That is good for workers and good businesses. Studies show that profit sharing that gives everyone a stake in the company's success can boost productivity and put money directly into employees' pockets. It's a win-win. Later this week in New Hampshire, I will have more to say about how we do this.
Another priority must be reforming our tax code. Now, we hear Republican candidates talk a lot about tax reform. But take a good look at their plans. Senator Rubio's would cut taxes for households making around $3 million a year by almost $240,000, which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family.
Well, that is a sure budget busting giveaway to the super wealthy, and that's the kind of bad economics you are likely to hear from any of the candidates on the other side. I have a different take... [applause] ... guided license principles. First, hard-working families need and deserve tax relief and simplification. Second, those at the top have to pay their fair share. That's why I support the Buffet Rule, which makes sure millionaires do not pay lower rates than their secretaries. I have called for closing the carried interest loophole, that lets wealthy financiers pay an artificially low rate.
And let's agree that hugely successful companies that benefit from everything that America has to offer, should not be able to game the system and avoid paying their fair share, especially while companies who can't afford high-priced lawyers and lobbyists end up paying more. [applause]
Alongside tax reform, it's time to stand up to efforts across our country to undermine worker bargaining power, which has been proven again and again to drive up wages. Republican governors like Scott Walker have made their names stomping on workers' rights, and practically all the Republican candidates hope to do the same as president. I will fight back against these mean-spirited, misguided attacks. Evidence— [applause] —evidence shows that the decline of unions may be responsible for a third of the increase of inequality among men, so if we want to get serious about raising incomes, we have to get serious about supporting union workers. [applause]
And let me just say a word here about trade. The Greek crisis as well as the Chinese stock market have reminded us that growth here at home and growth an ocean away are linked in a common global economy. Trade has been a major driver of the economy over recent decades, but it has also contributed to hollowing out our manufacturing base and many hard-working communities.
So we do need to set a high bar for trade agreements. We should support them if they create jobs, raise wages and advance our national security. And we should be prepared to walk away if they don't. To create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more Americans.
I love the saying by Abraham Lincoln who, in many ways, was not only the president who saved our union but the president who understood profoundly the importance of the middle class and the importance of government playing its role in providing opportunities. He talked about giving Americans a fair chance in the race of life. I believe that with all my heart, but I also believe it has to start really early, at birth.
High quality early learning, especially in the first five years, can set children on the course for future success and raise lifetime incomes by 25 percent. And— [applause] —and I'm committed to seeing every 4-year-old in America have access to high quality pre-school in the next 10 years. But I want to do more. I want to call for a great outpouring of support from our faith community, our business community, our academic institutions, from philanthropy and civic groups and concerned citizens, to really help parents, particularly parents who are facing a lot of obstacles, to really help prepare their own children in that 0 to 4 age group.
Eighty percent of your brain is physically formed by the age of 3. That's why families like mine read, talk and sing endlessly to our granddaughter. I've said that her first words are going to be enough with the reading and the talking and the singing. [laughter]
But we do it not only because we love doing it, even though, I'll admit, it's embarrassing, you know, reading a book to a two-week-old or a six-week-old or a 10-week-old, but we do it because we understand it's building her capacity for learning. And the research shows by the time she enters kindergarten, she will have heard 30 million more words than a child from a less advantaged background.
Think of what we are losing because we're not doing everything we can to reach out to those families, and we know, again, from so much research here in the United States and around the world that that early help, that mentoring, that intervention to help those often stressed-out young moms understand more about what they can do and to avoid the difficulties that stand in the way of their being able to really get their child off to the best possible start.
We also have to invest in our students and our teachers at every level, and in the coming weeks and months, I will lay out specific steps to improve our schools, make college truly affordable and help Americans refinance their student debt.
And let's embrace— [applause] —let's embrace the idea of lifelong learning. In an age of technological change, we need to provide pathways to get skills and credentials for new occupations and create online platforms to connect workers to jobs.
There are exciting efforts underway and I want to support and scale the ones that show results.
As we pursue all these policies, we cant forget our fellow Americans hit so hard and left behind by this changing world from the inner cities to coal country to Indian country.
Talent is universal; you find it everywhere. But opportunity is not. There are nearly 6 million young people aged 16 to 24 in America today who are not in school or at work. The numbers for young people of color are particularly staggering.
A quarter of young black men and nearly 15 percent of all Latino youth cannot find a job. We've got to do a better way of coming up to match the growing middle class incomes we want to generate with more pathways into the middle class.
I firmly believe that the best anti-poverty program is a job but that's hard to say if there aren't enough jobs for people that were trying to help lift themselves out of poverty.
That's why Ive called for reviving the new markets tax credit and empowerment zones to create greater incentives to invest in poor and remote areas. When— [applause] —when all Americans have the chance to study hard, work hard and share in our country's prosperity, that's fair growth. It's what I've always believed in and it's what I will fight for as president.
Now the third key driver of income, alongside strong growth and fair growth, must be long-term growth. Too many pressures in our economy push us toward short-termism. Many business leaders see this. They've talked to me about it.
One has called it the problem of quarterly capitalism. They say everything is focused on the next earnings report or the short-term share price and the result is too little attention on the sources of long-term growth: research and development, physical capital and talent.
Net business investment, which includes things like factories, machines and research labs, have declined as a share of the economy.
In recent years some of our biggest companies have spent more than half their earnings to buy back their own stock and another third or more to pay dividends. That doesn't leave a lot left to raise pay or invest in the workers who made those profits possible or to make new investments necessary to ensure a company's future success.
These trends need to change. And I believe many business leaders are eager to embrace their responsibilities, not just to today's share price but also to workers, communities and ultimately to our country and, indeed, our planet.
Now I'm not talking about charity; I'm talking about clear-eyed capitalism. Many companies have prospered by improving wages and training their workers that then yield higher productivity, better service and larger profits.
Now it's easy to try to cut costs by holding down or even decreasing pay and other investments to inflate quarterly stock prices but I would argue that's bad for business in the long run and it's really bad for our country.
Workers are assets. Investing in them pays off; higher wages pay off. Training pays off. To help more companies do that, I proposed a $1,500 tax credit for every worker they train and hire.  And I will soon be proposing a new plan to reform capital gains taxes to reward longer-term investments that create jobs, more than just quick trades. [applause]
I will also propose reforms to help CEOs and shareholders alike to focus on the next decade rather than just the next day. [applause]
Making sure stock buybacks aren't being used only for an immediate boost in share prices; empowering outside investors who want to build companies, but discouraging cut and run shareholders who act more like old-school corporate raiders. And nowhere will the shift from short-term to long-term be more important than on Wall Street.
As a former senator from New York, I know firsthand the role that Wall Street can and should play in our economy, helping main street grow and prosper, and boosting new companies that make America more competitive globally.
But as we all know in the years before the crash, financial firms piled risk upon risk, and regulators in Washington either could not or would not keep up. I was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing the risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight.
Under President Obama's leadership we have imposed tough new rules that deal with some of the challenges on Wall Street. Those rules have been under assault by Republicans in Congress and those running for president. I will fight back against these attacks and protect the reforms we have made. We can do that, and still ease burdens on community banks to encourage responsible loans to local people and businesses they know and trust.
We also have to go beyond Dodd-Frank. Too many of our major financial institutions are still too complex and too risky. And the problems are not limited to the big banks that get all the headlines. Serious risks are emerging from institutions in the so-called shadow banking system, including hedge funds, high-frequency traders, non-bank finance companies. So many new kinds of entities, which receive little oversight at all.
Stories of misconduct by individuals and institutions in the financial industry are shocking. HSBC allowing drug cartels to launder money, five major banks pleading guilty to felony charges for conspiring to manipulate currency exchange and interest rates. There can be no justification or tolerance for this kind of criminal behavior. [applause]
And while institutions have paid large fines and in some cases admitted guilt, too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences or none at all, even when they have already pocketed the gains. This is wrong, and on my watch it will change. Over the course... [applause] ... over the course of this campaign, I will offer plans to rein in excessive risks on Wall Street and ensure that stock markets work for everyday investors, not just high-frequency traders and those with the best or fastest connections. I will appoint and empower regulators who understand that too big to fail is still too big a problem. We will ensure... [applause]
We will ensure that no firm is too complex to manage or oversee. And we will also process individuals as well as firms when they commit fraud or other criminal wrongdoing. [applause]
When the government recovers money from corporations or individuals for harming the public, it should go into a separate trust fund to benefit the public. It could, for example, help modernize infrastructure or even be returned directly to taxpayers.
Now, reform is never easy, but we've done it before in our country, and we have to get it right this time.  And yes, we need leadership from the financial industry and across the private sector to join with us.
Two years ago, the head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Terry Duffy, published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that really caught my attention.
He wrote, and I quote, ""I'm concerned that those of us in financial services have forgotten who they serve and that the public knows it. Some Wall Streeters can too easily slip into regarding their work as a kind of moneymaking game divorced from concerns of the Main Street,"" unquote.
I think we should listen to Terry Duffy. Of course, long-term growth is only possible if the public sector steps up as well.
So it's time to end the era of budget brinkmanship and stop careening from one self-inflicted crisis to another. It's time to stop having debates over the small stuff and focus how we're going to tackle the big stuff together.
How do we respond to technological change in a way that creates more good jobs than it displaces or destroys? Can we sustain a boom in advanced manufacturing? What are the best ways to nurture startups outside the successful corridors, like Silicon Valley?
Questions like these demand thoughtful and mature debate from our policymakers and government, from our leaders in the private sector, our economists, our academics, others who can come together to the table and on behalf of America perform their patriotic duty to make sure our economy keeps working and our middle class keeps growing. [applause]
So government has to be smarter, simpler, more focused itself on long-term investments than short-term politics and be a better partner to cities, states and the private sector. Washington has to be a better steward of America's tax dollars and Americans' trust. And please, let's get back to making decisions that rely on evidence more than ideology. [applause]
That's what I'll do as president. I will seek out and welcome any good idea that is actually based on reality. [laughter] [applause]
I want to have principled and pragmatic and progressive policies that really move us forward together, and I will propose ways to ensure that our fiscal outlook is sustainable, including by continuing to restrain health care costs, which remain one of the key drivers of long-term deficits.
I will make sure Washington learns from how well local governments, businesses and nonprofits are working together in successful cities and towns across America.
You know, passing legislation is not the only way to drive progress. As president, I will use the power to convene, connect and collaborate to build partnerships that actually get things done, because above all, we have to break out of the poisonous partisan gridlock and focus on the long-term needs of our country. [applause]
I confess, maybe it's the grandmother in me, but I believe that part of public service is planting trees under whose shade you'll never sit, and the vision I've laid out here today for strong growth, fair growth and long-term growth all working together will get incomes rising again, will help working families get ahead and stay ahead. That is the test of our time.
And I'm inviting everyone to please join me to do your part. That's what great countries do. That's what our country always has done. We rise to challenges. It's not about left, right or center; it's about the future versus the past.
I'm running for president to build an America for tomorrow, not yesterday, an America built on growth and fairness, an America where if you do your part, you will reap the rewards, where we don't leave anyone behind. [applause]
Thank you all. Thank you. I just want to leave you with one more thought. I want every child, not just the granddaughter of a former president or former secretary of state, but every child to be able to reach for her God-given potential. Please join me in that mission—let's do it together.
Thank you all so much. [applause]

Thank you so much. [applause]
Well let me thank you, Strobe. It's great to be back at Brookings and there are a lot of long-time friends and colleagues who perch here at Brookings. Obviously, including Strobe and Martin, who I'll speak to in a minute. Also Bob Einhorn and Tammy Wittes.
This institution has hosted many important conversation over the years and I appreciate Strobe's reference to the event last night and the continuing dialogue about urgent issues facing our nation and the world. That's what brings me here today, back to Brookings, to talk about the question we're all grappling with: how to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and more broadly, how to protect ourselves and our allies from the full range of threats that Iran poses.
The stakes are high and there are no simple of perfectly satisfying solutions. So these questions, and in particular the merits of the nuclear deal recently reached with Iran, have divided people of good will and raised hard issues on both sides.
Here is how I see it. Either we move forward on the path of diplomacy and seize this chance to block Iran's path to a nuclear weapon or, we turn down a more dangerous path, leading to a far-less certain and riskier future. That's why I support this deal. I support it as part of a larger strategy toward Iran.
By now, the outcome in Congress is no longer in much doubt. So we've got to start looking made to what comes next, enforcing the deal, deterring Iran and its proxies and strengthening our allies. These will be my goals as president and today I want to talk about how I would achieve them.
Let me start by saying I understand the skepticism so many feel about Iran. I too am deeply concerned about Iranian aggression and the need to confront it. It's a ruthless, brutal regime that has the blood of Americans, many others and including its own people on its hands.
Its political rallies resound with cries of, ""Death to America."" Its leaders talk about wiping Israel off the face of the map, most recently just yesterday, and foment terror against it. There is absolutely no reason to trust Iran.
Now, Vice President Cheney may hope that the American people will simply forget, but the truth is, by the time President Obama took office and I became secretary of State, Iran was racing toward a nuclear capability.
They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle, meaning that they had the material, scientists and technical know how to create material for nuclear weapons. They had produced and installed thousands of centrifuges, expanded their secret facilities, established a robust uranium enrichment program and defied their international obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. And they haven't suffered many consequences.
I voted for sanctions again and again as a senator from New York. But they weren't having much effect. Most of the world still did business with Iran. We needed to step up our game.
So President Obama and I pursued a two-prong strategy: pressure and engagement. We made it clear that the door to diplomacy was open if Iran answered the concerns of the international community in a serious and credible way.
We simultaneously launched a comprehensive campaign to significantly raise the cost of Iranian defiance. We systematically increased our military capabilities in the region, deepening our cooperation with partners and sending more fire power, an additional aircraft carrier, battleship, strike aircraft and the most advanced radar and missile defense systems available.
Meanwhile, I traveled the world capital by capital, leader by leader, twisting arms to help build the global coalition that produced some of the most effective sanctions in history.
With President Obama's leadership, we worked with Congress and the European Union to cut Iran off from the world's economic and financial system. And one by one, we persuaded energy-hungry consumers of Iranian oil, like India and South Korea, to cut back.
Soon, Iran's tankers sat rusting in port. Its economy was collapsing.
These new measures were effective because we made them global. American sanctions provided the foundation, but Iran didn't really feel the heat until we turned this into an international campaign so biting that Iran had no choice but to negotiate. They could no longer play off one country against another; they had no place to hide.
So they started looking for a way out. I first visited Oman to speak with the sultan of Oman in January of 2011, went back later that year. The sultan helped set up a secret back channel. I sent one of my closest aids as part of a small team to begin talks with the Iranians in secret.
Negotiations began in earnest after the Iranian election in 2013. First, the bilateral talks led by Deputy Secretary Bill Burns and Jake Sullivan that led to the interim agreement, then the multilateral talks led by Secretary John Kerry, Secretary Ernie Moniz and Undersecretary Wendy Sherman.
Now there's a comprehensive agreement on Iran's nuclear program. Is it perfect? Well, of course not. No agreement like this ever is.
But is a strong agreement? Yes, it is. And we absolutely should not turn it down.
The merits of the deal have been well-argued, so I won't go through them in great detail here. The bottom line is that it accomplishes the major goals we set out to achieve. It blocks every pathway for Iran to get a bomb, and it gives us better tools for verification and inspection and to compel rigorous compliance.  Without a deal, Iran's breakout time, how long they need to produce enough material for a nuclear weapon, would shrink to a couple of months. With a deal, that breakout time stretches to a year, which means that if Iran cheats, we'll know it, and we'll have time to respond decisively.
Without a deal, we would have no credible inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. With a deal, we'll have unprecedented access; we'll be able to monitor every aspect of their nuclear program.
Now, some have expressed concern that certain nuclear restrictions expire after 15 years. And we need to be vigilant about that, which I'll talk more about in a moment. But other parts are permanent, including Iran's obligations under the Non-proliferation Treaty and their commitment to enhanced inspections under the additional protocol.
Others have expressed concern that it could take up to 24 days to gain access to some of Iran's facilities when we suspect cheating. I'd be the first to say that this part of the deal is not perfect. Although the deal does allow for daily access to enrichment facilities and monitoring of the entire nuclear fuel cycle.
It's important to focus on that, because being able to monitor the supply chain is critical to what we will find out and how we will be able to respond. But our experts tell us that even with delayed access to some places, this deal does the job. Microscopic nuclear particles remain for years and years. They are impossible to hide. That's why Secretary Moniz, a nuclear physicist, has confidence in this plan.
And some are suggested we just go back to the negotiating table and get a better, unspecified deal. I can certainly understand why that may sound appealing, but as someone who started these talks in the first place, and built our global coalition piece by piece, I can assure you it is not realistic. Plus, if we walk away now, our capacity to sustain and enforce sanctions will be severely diminished.
We will be blamed, not the Iranians.
So if we were to reject this agreement, Iran would be poised to get nearly everything it wants without giving up a thing. No restrictions on their nuclear program. No real warning if Tehran suddenly rushes toward a bomb. And the International Sanctions regime would fall apart, so no more economic consequences for Iran, either. Those of use who have been out there on the diplomatic front lines know that diplomacy is not the pursuit of perfection; it's the balancing of risk.
And on balance, the far riskier course right now would be to walk away. Great powers can't just junk agreements and expect the rest of the world to go along with us. We need to be reasonable and consistent, and keep our word, especially when we are trying to lead a coalition.
That is how we will make this and future deals work. But it is not enough to say, ""yes,"" to the deal. Of course it isn't.We have to say, yes, and—yes, and we will enforce it with vigor and vigilance. Yes, and we will embed it in a broader strategy to confront Iran's bad behavior in the region. Yes, and we will begin from day one to set the conditions, so Iran knows it will never get a nuclear weapon, not during the term of the agreement, not after, not ever. We need to be clear. And I think we have to make that very clear to Iran about what we expect from them. This is not the start of some larger diplomatic opening and we shouldn't accept that this deal will lead to broader changes in their behavior.
That shouldn't be a promise for proceeding, instead we need to be prepared for three scenarios. First, Iran tries to cheat, something it's been quite willing to do in the past. Second, Iran tries to wait us out, perhaps it waits to move for 15 years when some, but not all restrictions expire. And third, Iran ramps up the dangerous behavior in the region, including its support for terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.
I believe the success of this deal has a lot to do with how the next president grapples with these challenges. So let me tell you what I would do. My starting point will be one of distrust.
You remember President Reagan's line about the Soviets: Trust but verify? My approach will be distrust and verify. We should anticipate that Iran will test the next president, they'll want to see how far they can bend the rules. That won't work if I'm in the white house.
I will hold the line against Iranian noncompliance, that means penalties even for small violations, keeping our allies on board, but being willing to snapback sanctions into place unilaterally if we have to, working with congress to close any gaps in the sanctions. Right now members of congress are offering proposals to that affect and I think the current administration should work with them to see whether there are additional steps that could be taken.
Finally it means insuring that the IAEA has the resources it needs from finances to personnel to equipment to hold Iran's feet to the fire. The most important thing we can do to keep Iran from cheating or trying to wait us out is to shaped Iranian expectations right from the start. The Iranians and the world need to understand that we will act decisively if we need to.
So here is my message to Iran's leaders, The United States will never allow you to acquire a nuclear weapon. As president, I will take whatever action is necessary to protect the united states and our allies, I will not hesitate to take military action if Iran attempts to obtain a nuclear weapon, and I will set up my successor to be able to credibly make the same pledge. We will make clear to Iran that our commitment to prevention will not waver depending on who is in office, it's permanent.
Should it become necessary in the future having exhausted peaceful alternatives to turn to military force, we will have preserved and in some cases enhanced our capacity to act. And because we have proven our commitment to diplomacy first, the world will more likely join us.
Then there is the broader issue of countering Iran's bad behavior across the region. Taking nuclear-weapons out of the equation is crucial because an Iran with nuclear weapons is so much more dangerous, than an Iran without them.
But even without nuclear weapons, we still see Iran's fingerprints on nearly every conflict across the Middle East. They support bad actors from Syria, to Lebanon, to Yemen. They vow to destroy Israel. And that's worth saying again. They vow to destroy Israel. We can not ever take that lightly, particularly when Iran ships and advanced missiles to Hezbollah and the ayatollah outlines an actual strategy for eliminating Israel, or talks about how Israel won't exist in 25 years just like he did today.
And in addition to the malicious activity they already underwrite, we have got to anticipate that Iran could use some of the economic relief they get from this deal to pay for even more. So as President I will raise the costs for their actions and confront them across the board. My strategy will be based on five strong pillars.
First, I will deepen America's unshakeable commitment to Israel's security, including our long standing tradition of guaranteeing Israel's qualitative military edge. I'll increase support for Israeli rocket and missile defenses and for intelligence sharing. I'll sell Israel the most sophisticated fire aircraft ever developed. The F-35. We'll work together to develop and implement better tunnel detection technology to prevent arms smuggling and kidnapping as well as the strongest possible missile defense system for Northern Israel, which has been subjected to Hezbollah's attacks for years.
Second, I will reaffirm that the Persian Gulf is a region of vital interest to the United States. We do not want any of Iran's neighbors to develop or acquire a nuclear weapon's program either. So we want them to feel and be secure. I will sustain a robust military presence in the region, especially our air and naval forces. We'll keep the Strait of Hormuz open. We'll increase security cooperation with our Gulf allies, including intelligence sharing, military support and missile defense to ensure they can defend against Iranian aggression. Even if that takes the form of cyberattacks or other non-traditional threats.
Iran should understand that the United States and I as President, will not stand by as our Gulf allies and partners are threatened. We will act. Third, I will be a coalition to counter Iran's proxies, particularly Hezbollah. That means enforcing and strengthening the rules prohibiting the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah. Looking at new ways to choke off their funding and pressing our partners to treat Hezbollah as the terrorist organization that it is.
It's time to eliminate the false distinction that some still make between the supposed political and military wings. If you're part of Hezbollah, you're part of a terrorist organization, plain and simple. Beyond Hezbollah, I'll crack down on the shipment of weapons to Hamas. And push Turkey and Qatar to end their financial support. I'll press our partners in the region to prevent aircrafts and ships owned by companies linked to Iran's revolutionary guard from entering their territories, and urge our partners to block Iranian plans from entering their airspace on their way to Yemen and Syria.
Across the board, I will vigorously enforce and strengthen, if necessary, other American sanctions on Iran and its revolutionary guard for its sponsorship of terrorism, its ballistic missile program and other destabilizing activities.  I'll enforce and strengthen, if necessary, our restrictions on sending arms to Iran and from Iran to bad actors like Syria, and I'll impose these sanctions on everyone involved in these activities, whether they're in Iran or overseas. This will be a special imperative, as some of the U.N. sanctions lapse, so the U.S. and our partners have to step up.
Fourth, I'll stand, as I always have, against Iran's abuses at home, from its detention of political prisoners, to its crack down on freedom of expression, including online. Its inhumane policies hold back talented and spirited people. Our quarrel is not and never has been that the Iranian people. They'd have a bright future, hopeful future if they weren't held back by their leaders.
As I've said before, I think we were too restrained in our support of the protests in June 2009 and in our condemnation of the government crack down that followed. That won't happen again. We will enforce, and if need be, broaden our human rights sanction and I will not rest until every single American detained or missing in Iran is home.
Fifth, just to the nuclear agreement needs to be embedded in a broader Iran policy. Our broader Iran policy needs to be embedded in a comprehensive regional strategy that promotes stability and counters extremism.
Iran, like ISIS, benefits from chaos and strife. It exploits other countries' weaknesses and the best defense against Iran are the countries and governments being strong, that they can provide security and economic opportunity to their own people and they must have the tools to push back on radicalization and extremism.
Helping countries get there will take time and strategic discipline, but it's crucial that the United States leads this effort. I will push for renewed diplomacy to solve the destructive regional conflicts that Iran fuels. We have to bring sufficient pressure on Assad to force a political solution in Syria, including a meaningful increase in our efforts to train and equip the moderate Syrian opposition, something I called for early in the conflict, and the United States must lead in assisting those who have been uprooted by conflict, especially the millions of Syrian refugees now beseeching the world to help them.
As Pope Francis reminded us, this is an international problem that demands an international response, and the United States must help lead that response. That's who we are, and that's what we do.
So our strategy needs to cover all these bases, Iran's nuclear ambitions and its support of terrorism, its hatred of Israel and its cruelty towards its citizens, its military resources and its economic strengths and weaknesses. We need to be creative, committed and vigilant, and on every front, we need to keep working closely with our friends and partners.
On that note, let me just spend a minute speaking about the serious concerns that Israel's leaders have about this deal. Israel has every reason to be alarmed by a regime that both denies its existence and seeks its destruction.  I would not support this agreement for one second if I thought it put Israel in greater danger. I believe in my core that Israel and America must stand side by side, and I—I will always stand by Israel's right to defend itself, as I always have.  I believe this deal and a joint strategy for enforcing it makes Israel safer.
I say that with humility. I'm not Israeli. I don't know what it's like to live under constant threat from your neighbors in a country where the margin for error is so thin. I know that my saying this deal makes you safer won't alleviate the very real fears of the Israeli people.
But I have stood for Israeli security for a very long time. It was one of my bedrock principles as secretary of state. It's why I supported stronger defense systems, like the Iron Dome anti-rocket defense system, which proved so effective in protecting Israeli lives during the conflicts of 2012 and last summer, that's why I've worked closely with Israel to advance the two-state vision of a Jewish and Democratic Israel with secure and recognized borders, and it's why I believe we should expedite negotiations of a long-term military assistance agreement with Israel.
Let's not wait until 2017 when the current deal expires; let's get it done this year.
I would invite the Israeli prime minister to the White House during my first month in office to talk about all of these issues and to set us on a course of close, frequent consultation right from the start, because we both rely on each other for support as partners, allies and friends.
This isn't just about policy for me; it is personal. As president, I'm committed to shoring up and strengthening the relationship between our countries.
We have had honest disagreements about this deal. Now is the time to come together. Now is the time to remember what unites us and build upon it.
And so I know well that the same forces that threaten Israel threaten the United States. And to the people of Israel, let me say, you'll never have to question whether we're with you. The United States will always be with you. There have also been honest disagreements about the nuclear deal here at home. Smart, serious people can see issues like these differently, like my friend, Chuck Schumer, who's going to be an excellent leader in the Senate. I respect the skepticism that he and others feel, and I respect differences of opinion and people who advocate vigorously for their beliefs.
But I have a harder time respecting those who approach an issue as serious as this with unserious talk, especially anyone running to be president of the United States.
Several Republican candidates boast they'll tear up this agreement in 2017, more than a year after it's been implemented. That's not leadership; that's recklessness. It would set us right down the very dangerous path we have worked so hard to avoid.
I'm looking forward to a—a robust debate about foreign policy in this campaign. Where we have disagreements, we should lay them out, like if American ground forces in Iraq should engage in direct combat, as Scott Walker wants, or if we should keep Cuba closed, as Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush want. Let's debate these issues.  But let's debate them on the basis of facts, not fear. Let's resist denigrating the patriotism or loyalty of those who disagree with us, and let's avoid at all costs undermining America's credibility abroad. That only makes us weaker, and I am going to call it out whenever I see it.
I spent four years representing America abroad as America—secretary of state was one of the greatest privileges of my life, and knowing my fellow Americans were counting on the and rooting for me, not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans, meant to great deal.
We are all one team, the American team and that doesn't change, no matter how much we may disagree. I can tell you from personal experience we are stronger overseas, when we are united at home. So we simply have to find a way to work together better than we have been doing. There is a lot Democrats and Republicans can and should agree on.
The United States should lead in the Middle East, we can agree on that. We should stand by our friends against Iranian aggression, we can agree on that, too. I believe the plan I have laid out today is one that all Americans could endorse, and I hope they will.
The next president will face threats from many quarters, from those we see today like terrorism from ISIS, aggressiveness from Putin, pandemics like Ebola, to all those we can't predict yet.
We need a leader who has a strong vision for the future, and the skill and determination to get us there. We can't stop the world from changing, but we can help to shape those changes, and we can do that by beating with strength, smarts and unyielding commitment to our values. You know, I saw that when I was first lady, senator, secretary of state, that when America leads with principal and purpose, other people and governments are eager to join us.
No country comes close to matching our advantages, the strength of our economy, the skill of our work force, tradition of innovation, our unmatched network of alliances and partnership. So, we are poised to remain that world's most admired and powerful nation for of long time, if we make this smart choices and practice smart leadership. That is what I will try to do as your president, and I believe as strongly as ever that our best days are ahead of us, and that America's greatest contributions to the world are yet to come.
Thank you all very much. [applause]
INDYK: Well, thank you, very much, Madam Secretary.
I was wondering what we could call this speech, and it occurred to me at the end it would be, ""From Hard Choices to Smart Choices."" Right? Or the ""Yes, And"" speech.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this second part of the event with Secretary Clinton, which is little a conversation that I will have with her, and then we'll take questions from the audience.
I wanted to start by saying, number one, it's a very clear and very strong speech. And if I had to summarize the basic elements of it, the message to Iran is, we will enforce, we will confront you when you try to destabilize the region, and we will deter you if you try to go for a nuclear weapon some time down the line.  And I wonder how you navigate what is a certain, unspoken tension between the fact that you're going to be taking a hard line against some of the—some of the destabilizing and nefarious activities of the Iranians, and at the same time, this agreement puts the United States into a partnership with Iran in terms of implementing it.
So how do you deal with that—that tension, the Iranians may feel, ""Hey, we're giving up all these things to do with our nuclear program and this is what we're going to get in return,"" is—is very tough American response?
CLINTON: Well, I don't see Iran as our partner in implementing the agreement. I believe that Iran is the subject of the agreement, that it now faces obligations that frankly, in many instances, it faced before the agreement and that they have a—signed an agreement where they are committing themselves to fulfill the terms of the agreement.
The agreement will be enforced not by Iran, the agreement will be enforced by the rest of the negotiators, the other countries plus the IAEA, and it will be and is intended to be quite burdensome and intrusive into Iran.
Now, maybe they believe that having signed the agreement, they can somehow avoid the consequences of the inspections and the other requirements, but I think they understand very well they're at the starting line, there are these demands that they are supposed to fulfill, there is a sequencing of you know, lifting of sanctions and other kinds of benefits that they receive in return for they're having taken the action required.
And I think they are, if anything, probably counting on the world led by the United States being distracted, being diverted, getting tired, not having the staying power to consistently enforce the agreement and hold Iran accountable, and I for one, want to make clear to them that that is not going to happen, that we will take seriously every aspect of this agreement and we will expect them to comply and there will be consequences if they do not.
INDYK: When you called for a—a regional strategy and outlined the—the elements of that, it really seems to come down to when you say this in the speech, Syria and what happens in Syria where Iran is very invested in the Assad regime. Does a regional strategy on your watch mean taking down the Assad regime?
CLINTON: Well, you know, Martin, it's not only Iran that is invested, we're—obviously it's now becoming public, we are learning much more about Russian investment, Russian troops on the ground. It may very well be opening the door to greater Russian involvement. There is no doubt that Russian has—Russia has been a principal funder and supplier throughout this entire terrible episode.
So we are facing the collapse of Syria, the survival thus far of the Assad regime, although it clearly has much less to govern than it did when this started, the open ungoverned areas that are hosting terrorist groups and the continuing commitment from Iran and Russia to propping up Assad.
So I—you know, I was the principal negotiator on the Geneva 2012 agreement, which Russia signed onto, which laid out a pathway to a political solution. It wasn't very long until Russia reneged on what they had signed. But I think it still provides a very credible framework threat from the terrorist groups and that the chaos in Syria can destabilize the region in ways that are bad for Iran. And therefore the higher the pressure is for some kind of reaction to what is going on inside Syria, and certainly the efforts that ISIS is making to take even more and hold territory in Iraq directly against what Iran sees as its interest, the continuing destabilization along the Lebanese border, there's all kinds of reasons why Iran is going to have to confront this instability.
So I think we—my view on this is we have to be talking, and pushing on, and raising the cost for Iran and for Russia all the time. Now, if Putin were sitting here—which is hard to imagine, but if he were—I should ask Strobe—Strobe is the expert. He would say, ""We're fighting terrorism, that's what we are doing. There may be a way to begin to join those efforts.""
INDYK: So—the—I remember well a speech that you gave when you were secretary of state, in which you warned the Gulf leaders about policies that were based on sand. President Obama in talking about the concerns of Iran's destabilizing activity in the region said, ""Look, we can help protect our Gulf Arab allies from external threats. the problem is how to protect them from internal threats."" And you have been clear again that you will do that in terms of protecting against those threats, but I wanted—I wonder how you deal with that continuing challenge?
CLINTON: Well, you know very well it is a difficult one. I apologize for my voice I'm suffering under massive allergy assault. Yes, Republican histamines are everywhere. [laughter]
So—you know, Martin, this is one of the biggest problems we face, nobody can deny that much of the extremism in the world today is the direct result of policies and funding undertaken by the Saudi government and individuals. We would be foolish not to recognize that, I think increasingly they would be mistaken not to recognize that.
You can never be more extreme than the next extremist and I think they face some very serious internal problems, as do the other regimes. I am not sure they are convinced of that. I am not sure they believe that they have to figure out different ways of dealing with their own population and cooperating with each other, and cutting off funding, and exporting troublesome imams to elsewhere. But I think you have to be constantly beating that drum with them, and maybe now, given the rise of ISIS and the very clear threat they feel from, you know, Iranian activities in the Gulf that maybe there's an openness there. I know that the king was here last week, had a chance to, you know, meet with the president.
So perhaps there's more of an opportunity for a candid dialogue than we've had in the past. However, having said that, I still think we have to do what we need to do to defend them because the alternatives are hardly more promising.
INDYK: Israel. You—you've made a very clear effort in your speech to say that, ""It's time for healing, it's time to come together."" And when you're President that you would have the Prime Minister there in your first month. And that's very consistent I think as you said in your speech with your approach which has always been as I know, to put your arm around Prime Minister Netanyahu or rather...
CLINTON: Or any Prime Minister.
INDYK: Thank you from the Gurney Press. [laughter]
And—and, as you know that's a policy I support too. But some of my friends in Israel recently have said, ""That's not the way to deal with us, we need tough love."" Which is the alternative you know? Instead of rewarding bad behavior which you should be really speaking tough—more toughly to us. Well, how do you respond to that?
CLINTON: Well I think there's a lot of room for tough love, particularly in private and behind you know, closed doors. As I write in my book, you know, certainly Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have had very rigorous conversations that have gone on in person and over the phone.
But I—I just don't think it's a particularly productive approach for the United States to take because in large measure, it opens the door to everybody else to delegitimize Israel to, you know, pile on in ways that are not good for the—the strength and stability, not just of Israel obviously but of the region. And so, in the absence of you know, some kind of greater goal that we were trying to achieve by doing that I just don't think that is the smartest approach.
INDYK: All right. Let's go to your questions. I would ask you please to identify yourself and make sure that there's a question mark at the—at the end of your question.
Robin Wright ?
CLINTON: Hi, Robin.
QUESTION: Thank you. Robin Wright , U.S. Institute of Peace and former Brookings scholar.
Madam Secretary, you talked about how you would use American muscle to contain Iran. Can you tell us how you might use the new diplomatic channel to engage Iran on issues whether it's support for extremist groups or specifically dealing with the crisis in Syria. Would you be willing to use that diplomatic channel to engage Iran?
CLINTON: Yes, I would, Robin. And I—and I would because I think that we have to attempt to do that, you know?  When I first went to Oman in January of 2011, we didn't know whether any effort at some kind of secret channel would pay off. We still had the P5-plus-1 that was going on and we knew that eventually whatever the United States did would have to merge into the international approach.
But we had to begin to explore it. And we did. And we explored it over that summer. That's when we had the first, you know, visit to discuss anything could be possible. It takes awhile, as you know so well, being such an expert in this region, to figure out who's at the table, what the conversation's about, how seriously it will be taken, who's backing you up. And so, then when the—the talks actually started, just in the Iranian-American channel with Bill Burns and Jake Sullivan and Bob Einhorn was also involved.
It was—it was exploratory and it laid down some of the—the ground rules that we were looking for, and then eventually it was merged into the larger P5-plus-1 once there was a change in government in Iran and there was some real seriousness of effort.
So with respect to the other issues, I—I—I have very clearly, in the public arena, seen the Iranians at the highest levels reject any such discussion. They don't want to talk about Yemen, they don't want to talk about anything other than the nuclear agreement. Now that was a strategic decision we made back then.
You know, number one, it appeared to us in the early discussions with them, trying to figure out how to proceed. They wanted to talk about everything as a way to get some items on the table to trade off for the nuclear agreement, so that they would not have to make, perhaps, as many concessions as we were expecting them to make. That's why we kept very focused on just the nuclear program.
We also had the continuing challenge, and it would be even in this instance, of our friends in the Gulf not wanting us to talk about anything that affected them in a bilateral channel with the Iranians, and you can understand why. I mean, they—you know, if they weren't going to be at the table, they didn't want the United States talking about Yemen or talking about anything else of interest, of vital interest in their views to them.
So if there were a way to construct such a—a channel, I would be open to it, but I'm just laying out some of the difficulties of us being able to do that on this suite of other issues that are complex that touch many of the—the region's vital interests. And—and I think when it comes to Syria, we have historically not wanted to talk to Iran about Syria because we knew Iran was basically the principal supporter, propper up if you will, of Assad and we wanted to get the rest of the international community in harness to have a set of expectations and demands before we brought Iran in.
So we have to—you know, we have to readjust this all the time. Just as I said, diplomacy is the balancing of risk, it's also the—the constant evaluation of where the opportunities are, where the openings are, what possibly could happen now that didn't happen before. So I'm open but I am very sober about how it would have to be constructed and what it would actually cover and who would have to be either at the table or you know, in the—in the first chair behind, so that they didn't feel that they were being left out or negotiated over.
QUESTION: [inaudible]
CLINTON: Here comes your microphone.
QUESTION: Thanks for the microphone.
QUESTION: [off-mike]
CLINTON: So I think that's a very—it's an important questions. I don't know if you could hear the question. But it was—it was aimed at, what could you do to up the cost on Russia, for example, to be a more productive partner in seeking a solution? And how would we do more to—as I understood what you said, you know, work with our European partners on these securities issues that are challenging Europe? And we see that everyday with the refugees because it's humanitarian but it's also a security challenge as well?
Well, you know, I—I have been—I remain convinced that we need a concerted effort to really up the costs on Russia, and in particular on Putin. I think we have not done enough. I am in the category of people who wanted us to do more in response to the annexation of Crimea and the continuing destabilization of Ukraine. I understand the hesitation, not only in our country but most importantly, in Europe.
The sanctions came out of the all discussions and you know, maybe to some extent they have had you know, some impact. I think the falling oil price has had more impact and we've got to figure out how we you know, combine both in looking at ways to put more—to up the costs, to put more pressure on Putin. I think it's one of the long term security challenges that United States, Europe, and especially NATO face. And I don't think we can dance around it very much longer.
I mean, we all wish it wasn't the case. We all wish it would go away. We all wish that Putin would choose to modernize his country and move toward the west, instead of you know, sinking himself deeper into you know, historical roots of czar-like behavior and intimidation along borders, and projecting Russian power in places like Syria and elsewhere.
But I think the jury is in, I think that he intends to continue to do what he is doing and go as far as he can get away with. And I believe that we've got to regroup—we've got to regroup quickly, because I worry very much about what's happening in Syria right now.
Troops on the ground to allegedly protect military supplies. What is Russia's real objective? You know, the stated objective, the public objective, to fight terrorism, has always been their rationale. Why did they support Assad? Because after Assad there would be terrorism. Now, obviously if we had a different approach from the beginning working together we might've avoided this. We might've actually help to midwife a political transition. So I think we've got to spend a lot more time.
All the—you know, all the Russian experts that you know, that thought that their work was done after the fall of the Berlin Wall, I hope that they will be dusting off their materials and I'm looking right at Strobe Talbott, and you know, get back in the game with us. Because, I think Russia's objectives are to stymie and to confront and to undermine American power whenever and wherever they can. I don't think there's much—you know, I don't think there's much to be surprised about that.So where we can work with them? You know, that's one of the—you know, one of the criticisms that sometimes comes from the right, the Republicans. You know, ""What did the reset ever accomplish?"" Well, Medvedev was president actually quite a lot. We did the New START agreement. We got cooperation on Iran because when we got the Security Council to pass the sanctions that we had been working so hard on, that was under Medvedev in June of 2010. We got support to ship lethal material and equipment across to Russia to resupply our troops. We got a lot.
Now, that all changed once you know, Putin announced he was going to be president again now. There's—I don't admire very much about Mr. Putin, but the idea you can stand and say, ""I will be your next president."" That does have a certain, you know, attraction to it. [laughter]
So, you know, I think we've got—we've really—we are not spending the—the time. We're not thinking, we're not digging deep into what are we going to do. So, to answer the question of the—of the woman who asked, we have to do more to get back talking about how we try to confine, contain, deter Russian aggression in Europe and beyond. And try to figure out what are the best tools for doing that and don't lose sight of the architect because we're going to have a lot of issues up there well.
So, I—I—I was always of that opinion. Expressed it vocally within the administration. And nothing that has happened since has in anyway persuaded me other wise.
QUESTION: And I'll just do a quick follow up on that which is more generally, you know. You—you've got to take on the Russians and Putin. You've got to deal with a very comprehensive strategy for a very complicated part of the world called the Middle East. How do you do the rebalancing to Asia on top of all of this?
CLINTON: Well, I—I do think we're capable of doing more than one thing although sometimes it appears difficult. And—and I think we've got to be much more global in our thinking and globally present. The rebalancing to Asia, otherwise known as the pivot, was in response to the very real sense of abandonment that Asian leaders expressed to me. My phone calls to them before I ever went to the region in February of 2009, you know, they—they believed that because we were focused in Afghanistan and we were so focused in Iraq, and obviously had to be given all that we had invested there, that we were just not paying attention to the developments in Asia. I think we've come along in some ways in trying to rebalance but we have a long to go.
And there's much at stake in how we deal with all the players in Asia. I'm hoping that the upcoming trip I have with President Xi Jinping produces some positive outcomes. I thought the climate agreement was quite consequential having been in Copenhagen in '09 with the President when we literally had to break into a meeting where the Chinese were consolidating India, South Africa and Brazil against any kind of movement toward the non advanced economies taking responsibility. So I think we've got some good stakes in the ground but we don't have a—a strategy yet that is going to be consistent.
And the final thing I'll say about this, Martin, and I alluded to it in my remarks, I think one of our—one of our real problems right now is we don't have a consistent foreign policy that is bipartisan, let alone non-partisan. And I think that's a problem.
I mean, I was appalled when those Republican senators wrote to the ayatollah. I thought it was incredibly, you know, short-sighted and you know, wrong-headed. And I don't think—I don't know what we rebuild a consistent foreign policy from administration to administration, regardless of Republican or Democrat. You know, it was a lot easier in a bipolar world, us versus the Soviet Union, I understand that, but I think we really have to work at it. And we can't work at it if we don't have a set of strategic pillars and organizing principles that we can present to our own people and present to the Congress and present to the world.
So I think we have work to do.
INDYK: Andrea?
QUESTION: Madam Secretary, when you talk about the policies with Syria and Putin, was it, in retrospect, a mistake for the administration after you left office to pull back on Labor Day, a couple of years ago, make the deal with Russia on the chemical weapons? Yes, the weapons were disposed of, but that created a different partnership, if you will, on diplomacy.
And secondly, with reference to our colleague from Germany, what should America do to step up to the crisis of migration? Even if it's not on our front door, it is a moral issue, is it not, for the world? Thank you.
CLINTON: As to the first one, you know, it's always difficult in hindsight to say what could have happened if something different had been done. IF we remember back to that time, prime minister Cameron had lost the vote in the parliament. He wanted to show support for the president's policy of taking some limited military action in light of Syria's use of chemical weapons.
So it became clear that there was going to be a difficult vote in the Congress, not clear at all that it would successful, which would have left the president with authority, certainly, with executive authority to act. But since it had become a public debate, it would have been a much more difficult decision for him to make.
I do think that not being able to follow through on it cost us. I am certain of that. That still comes back in conversations that people have with me, both here at home and—and people from other countries, but I do think it was a net positive to get as much of the chemical weapons out as we could, and there was no way we could have done that without Russian cooperation. I think there was hope after that kind of cooperation produced positive results that then, we could go back to talking more broadly with the Russians about what needed to be done in Syria and what needed to be done with Assad. They did not reciprocate on that. So you know, I think it's like much in—in international relations, it's a—it's a mixed picture, some positive, you know, some—some negative.
With respect to the refugees, I have said I think that you know, we're coming up on the U.N. General Assembly. I think there should be an emergency global gathering where the U.N. literally tries to get commitments. You know, we did that with Haiti. After the Haiti earthquake, we had a huge gathering at the U.N. where literally it was like a pledging conference, where we said, ""What are you going to do?"" What—you know, ""What can you contribute?""
And little countries to big countries all stepped up and it was a great show of support in the face of a terrible natural disaster. We need to do something similar, and I've—I've publicly called on the U.N. to convene such a gathering. I do it again today in front of all of you.
The United States has to be at the table, has to be leading it. We were in a strong position to do that on Haiti. I think, even though it's not on our doorstep, we have a real interest in working not just with our European friends, I think this is a global responsibility. And if you're too far away or for whatever reason you don't think you can take refugees then you have to contribute money.
You should be supporting not only those refugees fleeing, but the incredible work that Jordan and Lebanon and Turkey have been doing, and they have not gotten the financial support they need. In fact, the last I checked, the U.N. appeal had only reached 37 percent, so there is both financial work and contributions that need to be forthcoming and countries need to be more open and willing to take refugees.
I obviously want the United States to do our part but I also want this to be a global response. So I hope that with all these leaders gathered, with Pope Francis addressing the United Nations General Assembly in just about two weeks, we can see something like that very visible with people literally making their commitments nation by nation, or in the case of the EU or other organizations as well.
INDYK: I think we're going to have to close it out, but I see two hands going up. Do you mind taking two together? First is Ivan and then Joe.
QUESTION: Madam Secretary, I also want to add my thanks for a very forceful, unequivocal, and clear speech bringing a position that sounds eminently defensible. One of the silver linings potentially of the Iran deal is an alignment of interest in the region between Israel and the moderate Arab countries, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, et cetera—the gulf states. If you agree with that, how would you see capitalizing on those shared interests, those concerns about Iran going forward? How would you promote the shared interests as a way of bridging more peace to the region?
INDYK: Joe, quick question?
QUESTION: Joe (Santioni), the pleasure is mine. Thank you for your measured and fact based approach to this. Let me bring you to the politics of the issue. What explains that we don't have a single Republic senator in support of this? Is this is ideological divide between the parties? Or raw partisan politics?
CLINTON: Well I'll restrain myself and answer the first questions first. I think there is an opportunity here to succeed, I really do. I don't think it's easy. But let's just go back a few years.
Not so long ago, Israel and Turkey were working very closely together on a number of issues. Then came the flotilla and then came the response by the Israeli military, then came many years of you know, real hard feelings that got harder and harder and we lost what was a—not just a - a working relationship but a real bridge.
Similarly, there have been a number of instances where in the past, Israel has worked in common concert with a number of the gulf countries. Israel is now back in a very productive relationship with Egypt, obviously with Jordan. So there are the pieces of national and regional interests here that I think very diligently and probably frustratingly could be pulled back together.
 I don't—I don't know that it's something the United States can lead, but it's certainly something that we can try to catalyze and encourage. And I think there is potential there because as I said in my speech, I will do everything I can to convince Turkey and (Qatar) that supporting Hamas is not in their interest. It's not in the region's interest. It's certainly not in Egypt's interest. They both care deeply about, you know, what happens in Egypt for somewhat different reasons than others, but they care.
And so I think we have to build the case and I think American diplomats could help build that case. And then look for ways—I mean, I spent, you know, literally years trying to get the Israelis to finally apologize to the Turks on the flotilla. And there was a memorable day during one of my vacations where I was literally, you know, talking to the Israelis. I was talking to Henry Kissinger. I was talking to everybody I could find to make the strategic argument which we all believed, that the sooner Israel did that, the sooner they could get back to some kind of discussion perhaps.
Finally that happened when President Obama went to Israel. And I was very happy that, you know, now we have a different Turkey with a different kind of, set of challenges, but interests remain the same. Turkey's interest for stability are not so different than they were, even though some of the leadership attitudes seem to have altered. So I would like to see us do everything we can. I would make a high priority of that.
I hope that this administration in the last, you know, year-and-a-half or so of it, term, will be similarly doing that because, let's start seeing what we can do. It kind of goes back to Robin's question. You know, you don't know what you can achieve until you try to put the pieces together. And I think the more we can try to put those pieces together, the more we'll know whether or not something can come up.
With respect to the lack of support for the agreement, honestly, I think it's—it's—it's in some instances genuine. Just as I said in my remarks, there are people who I deeply respect on the Democratic side certainly and I would respect them on the Republican side as well, who just have concerns that they don't feel have been answered. But I think the driving force behind it is, you know, to close ranks against the president, against this kind of diplomacy, but without offering an alternative.
And that's what I find, I mean I don't mind debating alternatives. I mean, when we did the New Start Treaty, it was really hard to get the votes for that. I remember, you know, going up and making the case, but we got some Republican votes. But we're living in a very partisan atmosphere right now. And I do think we have to do more. Just as we, and I'll end with this by saying, just as we have to in diplomacy, reach out to people constantly, if not to persuade them to join with us, to eliminate an argument that they have, that they won't join, because they have been consulted. They have been brought along, they have been briefed. We have to do that with the Congress as well. And it's not—it's not easy if they don't even have open minds.
But we still have to do it so we can be in the position of saying, you know, ""We told you this, we offered you this, we briefed you this, we gave you this information and you haven't come forth with any kind of, you know, rational, or rationale to oppose us.  You're just opposing us. So it's—it's—it's very political, after discounting those who I think are—are genuinely skeptical.
INDYK: Madame Secretary Hillary, thank you very much for—for a very powerful series and—and clear-headed explication of your position on Iran, Middle East and even broader. This is precisely what we expect from you and precisely what we at Brookings want to try to promote in this presidential debate, so we are very grateful to you.
Please join me in thanking Hillary. [applause]

In a CNN exclusive, the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, joins us now live.
This is her first live interview from the campaign trail.
Madam Secretary, thanks very much for joining us.
CLINTON: Great to talk to you, Wolf.
I'm in Laconia, New Hampshire.
BLITZER: It's a lovely place. I'm sure you're going to be spending a lot of the time there, Iowa, among other states.
If—you took—you certainly did take a lot of fire from the Republicans at the CNN debate last night. I assume you watched it, especially from the lone female candidate up on the stage, Carly Fiorina.
She said if you want to stump a Democrat, she said, ask them about Hillary Clinton's accomplishments as secretary of State.
If you were on that debate stage with her, what would you say was your number one accomplishment as secretary of State?
CLINTON: You know, Wolf, I didn't get to see all of their debate, but I saw enough of it to know that this is just the usual back and forth political attacks, the kinds of things you say when you're on a debate stage and you really don't have much else to say.
I didn't hear anything from any of them about how they're going to make college more affordable or get down student debt, or get equal pay for equal work for women, what they're going to do to make sure that we deal with the challenges of raising incomes for hardworking people.
So I don't really pay a lot of attention to this kind of rhetoric that heats up the debate stage. They're all trying to vie for more attention from, obviously, the Republican Party. I'm going to let them decide how best to do it.
But if anybody is interested, you know, there's a long list about what I have done and I'm very proud of it. You can read my book, ""Hard Choices,"" read about how I negotiated a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. You can read about how I put together the coalition that led to international sanctions against Iran. You can read about what I did when I was first lady to get the children's health insurance program, or as senator, working across the aisle on issues like getting better health care for our veterans.
You know, this is just the silly season. I am looking forward to eventually debating on that stage whoever they finally nominate once they get around to doing that.
BLITZER: All right, so listen to what Carly Fiorina also said, Madam Secretary, about some controversial videos opposing Planned Parenthood, an organization you support.
Listen to this.
[begin video clip]
CARLY FIORINA, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, to watch these tapes, watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.
This is about the character of our nation.
[end video clip]
BLITZER: All right, Planned Parenthood...
CLINTON: You know, of course not...
BLITZER:?—says that video doesn't depict—Madam Secretary, hold on. I just want to explain.
CLINTON: That's right.
BLITZER: Planned Parenthood says the video doesn't depict an aborted fetus. They says—they said that was from a miscarriage, it had nothing to do with Planned Parenthood.
This is an organization, though, you support.
First of all, have you seen those very, very controversial videos?
CLINTON: Well, Wolf, let's—let's break down what's happening here, because I think it's important. I know that there's a move on by some of the Republicans in the Congress to actually shut down the United States government over their demand that we no longer give federal funding to Planned Parenthood to perform the really necessary health services that they do for millions of women.
So let's put aside for a moment here that there is no debate and there should be absolutely no argument that Planned Parenthood does cancer screenings, it helps provide family planning and contraceptive advice, it works to provide, you know, some of the most difficult kinds of counseling when it comes to giving an HIV test, for example.
What this is about is the fact that some of the Planned Parenthood facilities perform abortions, which is legal under the laws of the United States.
I understand that the Republican Party and particularly the candidates we heard from last night, wish that were not the case, wish that abortion were illegal and they could turn the clock back.
So I think we ought to be very clear that Planned Parenthood has served to provide health care, necessary health care for millions of women. And I think it deserves not only our support, but the continuing funding from the federal government so that these women and girls who are seeking the kinds of services that are provided will be able to achieve that.
BLITZER: All right, have you—are you confident that Planned Parenthood, Madam Secretary, or any of its affiliated groups, if you will, haven't violated any federal laws?
CLINTON: Well, Wolf, let me tell you what I know, and that is there is a—a willingness on the part of Planned Parenthood to answer questions. They have been doing so. Some people may not want to hear the answers, but they have certainly put those answers out there into the public arena.
And if the issue—the core issue that some on the stage last night or some in the Congress are trying to promote or trying to raise questions about has to do with the kind of research that is done legally in the United States, then that is an issue that goes far beyond any Planned Parenthood example.
So I—I think it's important to sort out—there's a lot of emotion. There's a lot of accusations that are being hurled about. I think it's important to sort out and try to actually figure out what is going on. If it's the services that they are trying to shut down, like providing family planning or breast cancer screenings, that is just wrong and women deserve to be given support to get those services provided.
If they want to shut down the legal provision of abortion services, then they've got a bigger problem, because, obviously, they—Planned Parenthood does not use federal dollars to do that.
And if they are more focused on the research that is going on, then that's a set of issues that certainly is not only about Planned Parenthood.
So I—I would hope...
BLITZER: But a...
CLINTON:?—that the Republicans, and particularly the Republicans in the House, led by Speaker Boehner, would not put our country and our economy in peril pursuing some kind of emotionally politically charged partisan attack on Planned Parenthood to shut our government down.
BLITZER: All right...
CLINTON: I think that would be a very, very unfortunate decision.
BLITZER: All right, let's talk about another source of criticism you received last night, this one from the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie. He said at the debate, you can't tell the American people the truth. Those are his words about your email, whole controversy. He says you should be prosecuted for having a server in your basement. [laughter]
He says with national security secrets running through it. He says Russians, Chinese, even 18-year-olds could have hacked into your server.
You—you think that was possible, that they hacked into your server?
CLINTON: There's no evidence of that. And, again, this is—you know, this is overheated rhetoric, baseless charges trying to somehow, you know, gain a footing in the debate and in the primary. And it really doesn't deserve any comment.
BLITZER: It took you a long time to say you're sorry about what happened, the mistakes you made in organizing that server to begin with.
Why did it take so long?
CLINTON: Well, you know, I was trying to explain, uh, what had happened and obviously it was clear that I should have used two different email accounts and I said that that was a mistake, I'm sorry, I've taken responsibility.
But I've also, for more than a year now, been asking to testify before the Congressional committee that is investigating the situation in Benghazi, they would not let me appear.
Finally—and I'm very happy about this—I will be appearing, toward the end of October, and I will look forward to answer all their questions.
I'm trying to be as transparent as possible. That's why people are reading the contents of the emails that are being released. It's why I've turned over my server. It's why I will testify.
BLITZER: You've dismissed Donald Trump's campaign as entertainment, suggested, in part, he's not really serious. But the top Republican candidate right now, Donald Trump, and, for that matter, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, they're all political outsiders and your main Democratic opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, he's pulling ahead in some of these polls in New Hampshire and Iowa. He's running as an outsider, as well.
So how do you deal with that?
Why is Bernie Sanders, for example, ahead of you in these polls in New Hampshire and Iowa right now?
CLINTON: Well, I—I've said for a long time, polls are going to go up, they're going to go down. I'm very confident and very comfortable about our strategy. I feel that our campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire, all the early states, and now we're moving on to the states that come after, are really coming together well.
I'm excited by the level and intensity of the support that I have. So I always thought this would be a competitive election. I'm looking forward to it. This is an important job. This is the most important job not only in our country, but in the world. And people have to fight hard. They have to make their case and they have to earn the votes of the American voters.
BLITZER: You sat next to Joe Biden when you were the secretary of State for four years. He's been the vice president of the United States now for almost seven years, a heartbeat away from the presidency.
If he does decide to run, will you be able to tell the American people that you're more qualified to be president than he is?
CLINTON: Well, Wolf, I'm not going to comment on a hypothetical and I'm certainly not going to comment on my good friend and former colleague. He has to make up his own mind about what's best for him and his family, as he wrestles with his choice.
But I will tell the American people I believe that my set of experiences, my plans for the future, my vision for what America should be, what I've already told voters I would do on everything from making college affordable to paying down student debt to tackling climate change by making us the clean energy superpower, dealing with substance abuse and addiction, like I did here in New Hampshire today.
I have a very comprehensive agenda that I think address the very issues that Americans are talking to me about. And I know that having been around the presidency, both as the first lady in the '90s and then as a member of President Obama's cabinet, working with other presidents, as a senator and even in private life, I feel very confident that I'm the right person at the right time to lead our country to deal with the growing issues around incomes that are not raising enough money for people to feel they've got a better future, about the kind of jobs we need more of, about how more workers get to share in the productivity by sharing the profits of what they helped produce.
I'm the one out there talking very specifically about what I would do because I want to run a campaign that lays out my agenda, because when I get elected, I'm going to start working on it immediately.
BLITZER: I know—I know your time is limited. A quick question, are you ready to tell Democrats, indeed, the American public today, that you're ready to accept more Democratic presidential debates than already scheduled?
You're under pressure to do so.
CLINTON: Well, Wolf, I have said from the very beginning, I look forward to debating. I look forward to the debate, you know, next month, you know, now just a month away. And I will certainly show up anywhere the Democratic National Committee tells us to show up, because I want us to have a good exchange of ideas and to make sure that Democratic voters first, and then general voters to follow, see exactly what we each stand for and what our positions are.
So, you know, I—I am ready and willing, no matter what they decide to show up and be there.
BLITZER: Are you ready to ask the DNC to authorize more Democratic presidential debates?
CLINTON: That's up to them. They can, you know, they made their decision. But I have made it clear that if they want to do more, I'm happy to do them.
BLITZER: Clearly, you're influential, though, with the DNC. And if you want more debates, I'm sure that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the DNC, would—would go ahead.
Let me ask you one final question before I let you go.
You've praised your husband as a great president.
So let me ask you this.
Would you be a better president than Bill Clinton was as president of the United States? [laughter]
CLINTON: Oh, Wolf, you know, that—that's one of those questions that I cannot and will not answer. I will say this. I think if you look at the last 35 years, actually, if you go back further, I think it's pretty indisputable that having a Democrat in the White House is good for our economy, better for our economy than the alternative.
I think my husband understood that and produced. I think President Obama inherited a—a really big and dangerous mess and has, you know, been able to get us out of that ditch.
So I'm not running for my husband's third term. I'm certainly not running for President Obama's third term. I'm running for my first term.
But I do believe that both of them understood what it would take to try to clean up the messes they inherited from their Republican predecessors and begin to get the economy and the country working again for everybody.
And that's exactly the kind of president I will be, as well.
BLITZER: Madam Secretary, thank you so much for joining us.
Good luck out there on the campaign trail.
We'll look forward to covering you. We'll look forward to covering, obviously, all of those Democratic presidential debates, as well.
Thanks very much for joining us.
CLINTON: Thank you so much, Wolf.
Good to talk to you.
BLITZER: Thank you.

Welcome, Secretary Clinton. We're glad to have you.
Let's start in the news, Syrian refugees.
CLINTON: Right.
DICKERSON: President Obama has said he will increase the number allowed into 10,000. Is that enough?
CLINTON: Now, look, we're facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II.
And I think United States has to do more. And I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000, and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in, looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women.
But I also want the United States to lead the world. And I have recommended that, at the upcoming U.N. General Assembly, there be an international meeting called by the secretary-general and literally get people to commit, putting money in, helping the front-line states, like Jordan and Turkey and Lebanon, who have absorbed a lot of refugees, working with the E.U. and the European countries, but getting everybody to make a contribution.
DICKERSON: Let me ask you about the underlying condition creating this refugee crisis.
You advocated for arming the Syrian rebels.
CLINTON: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
DICKERSON: That was then ultimately put in place. We now hear that that is not going well at all. Out of 12,000 Syrians that have been trained, there are only handful that can actually fight.
Was this a bad idea, or was this a bad idea—or was this a good idea poorly executed?
CLINTON: Well, John, I did recommend that, at the beginning of this conflict, we do more to help train those who were in the forefront of leading the opposition against Assad, looking to try to bring the moderates together.
A lot of these rebels, originally, they were—they were businesspeople, they were professional people, they were students. They had no training in going up against the Syrian army, which Assad clearly was going to use to the ultimate effect. That was not the decision taken at that time.
A lot of what I worried about has happened. There are now big ungoverned territories within Syria that are dominated by terrorist groups, ISIS being the best known, but not the only one. You have Iran and Russia increasingly moving in to support Assad and his constant bombardment against his own people.
And then you have these millions of refugees. So, where we are today is not where we were. And where we are today is that we have a failed program. You heard the testimony, five people trained for half—$500, half-a-billion dollars.
But I think we still have to keep working with the Turks, with the Jordanians, with others of our partners. We also have to do more to support the Kurds, something that I have also advocated.
DICKERSON: Let me ask you about Russia.
So, it looks like U.S. policy now is, we're not going to—train and equip has failed, so now we're going to turn to the Russians for help. These are the same Russians who are busy in Ukraine doing things we don't like them to do. The Israelis think that the Russians are involved with Hezbollah. Why are we turning to the Russians?
CLINTON: Well, I hope we're not turning to the Russians.
Let me just quickly say that I wouldn't give up on train and equip, but I sure would push the Pentagon to take hard look why what has been done has been such a failure and what more we could do to support, like, Kurdish fighters who are on the front lines.
And one of the difficulties we had in the train and equip is that we basically were trying to train people to only take on ISIS and terrorist networks. We were not training and equipping them to take on Assad or his military or his proxies, which include Hezbollah, by the way.
I hope we are not turning to the Russians in that way. I hope what we're doing—and this is what I support—and I heard Secretary Kerry say this is what we will be doing. And I think Secretary Carter has begun these conversations.
First of all, we have to figure out what they are doing. Russia has a long interest in Syria. They have had a base in—a naval base in Syria for a long time. They have a connection because a lot of Syrians were educated in the Cold War in Moscow and a lot of Russians actually moved to Syria.
So, they have not only deep links to Syria and Syrians, but they intend to support Assad for their own reasons. And we need to really unpeel what it is they're trying to accomplish and work with others to try to contain them.
And I want to just end by saying, if they are providing any equipment to Hezbollah, if they are supporting Hezbollah, which is the main fighting force on behalf of the Iranians to support Assad, but also a deadly threat to Israel, then we have got to take action, whether there are tougher sanctions or other kinds of actions to try to prevent that from happening.
DICKERSON: I want to ask you about something that came up in the Republican debate. Jeb Bush said, one thing was true about his brother. He kept America safe.
Do you agree with that?
CLINTON: I think it's a complicated question, because, of course, 9/11 happened.
I was a senator from New York. And I was basically consumed by my responsibility to help the people directly affected in my state and in the city.
So, it did happen. And then I do give President Bush credit for trying to bring the country together around the threats that we did face. I have said the war in Iraq was a mistake. I supported what happened in Afghanistan. So, if you sort it all out, you know, it's a mixed—it's a mixed picture.
DICKERSON: Let me take you back to the 2008 campaign, where Iraq was a conversation and U.S. security was a conversation.
You ran an ad, the 3:00 a.m. ad...
CLINTON: Yes.
DICKERSON: ... which became quite famous. Let's play that for our—our viewers.
CLINTON: My gosh. I haven't seen that in a long time. [laughter]
DICKERSON: Well, it's a throwback Sunday here.
[begin video clip]
NARRATOR: It's 3:00 a.m., and your children are safe and asleep. Who do you want answering the phone?
CLINTON: I'm Hillary Clinton. And I approve this message.
[end video clip]
[laughter]
DICKERSON: So, the question for you is, now you have been secretary of state.
CLINTON: Right.
DICKERSON: Benghazi.
CLINTON: Right.
DICKERSON: Was that your 3:00 a.m. phone call? And how well did you handle that crisis, by the standard you raised in that ad?
CLINTON: Well, of course it was a crisis. And we lost four brave Americans, including the person that I asked the president to send as ambassador, Chris Stevens.
But we live in a dangerous world. And even our diplomats are at threat. And that goes all the way back to, for goodness' sake, taking over our embassy in Tehran or the bombings of our embassy in Beirut, when President Reagan was in charge.
This is a dangerous world. And I think what we had to do during that period of time, in trying to protect our people after the attack on the consulate, getting them evacuated, not only working on what was going on in Libya, because, remember, we had embassies that were under attack or threatened to attack by terrorist groups across North Africa, indeed, across a much larger swathe of the world.
So, I think it was terribly tragic, what happened. I immediately asked for an independent review, just like former secretaries of state did. And I made that public. And the only other person who did that was Secretary Albright after our embassies were bombed in Africa.
So, my view on this is, we have to learn things. And we are always learning. We learned after Beirut. We learned after Tanzania and Kenya. We have learned after Benghazi, but we're not going to be able to represent the United States working out of hermetically sealed tanks. We are going to have to be out in the world.
DICKERSON: One more question on Benghazi. The charge is, in this campaign, that after it happened, there was a report inside the State Department and inside the government that this was a terrorist attack.
But in what we heard from the government at the time and from you was an emphasis on this video, that that had created the attack. And so the charge is that there was a political pressure to make the case more about the video than to talk about terrorism.
CLINTON: Well, I just don't think that's fair. And I'm going to testify about this at the end of October before the committee looking into this. I think it's the eighth investigation that the Congress has conducted.
There were two things going on simultaneously. I and others said that we were attacked. There was no doubt about that. That video, which was still spinning through the world, was being mentioned on social media. We had people climbing the walls at our embassy in Cairo even before the attack in Benghazi.
And we had a lot of other attacks. I had to call the president of one of our neighboring countries, Tunis, to try to get—in Tunis—to get them to help protect our embassy. So, I was worried about everything that was going on and how people were responding to that from North Africa to Pakistan, all the way to Indonesia.
DICKERSON: So, no political pressure to keep the story kind of a little more favorable to the administration?
CLINTON: Well, all I can tell you, I never felt any political pressure or did I feel any political reason to do anything other than what we tried to do, which was to immediately deal with the problems that were coming at us.
DICKERSON: So, questions about Benghazi have led to discovery of your personal server.
If we use this episode as a way to think about the way would you run your presidency, let's say there's a meeting at Clinton headquarters, and you're with your staff. And you're saying, looking at the e-mail situation from the day you decided, yes, to have the server, all the way to where we all now...
CLINTON: Right.
DICKERSON: ... what went well, what didn't go so well?
CLINTON: Well, look, I have said that I didn't make the best choice.
I should have used two separate e-mail accounts, one personal, one work-related. What I did was allowed. It was fully above board. People in the government certainly knew that I was using a personal e-mail.
But I have tried to be transparent. And that includes releasing 55,000 pages, which is unprecedented—nobody else that I'm aware of has ever done that—plus turning over the server, plus testifying at the end of October.
So, I think that people have questions. I want to try to answer them.
DICKERSON: Was it a failure in judgment on your part?
CLINTON: Well, look, it was permitted. It was allowed. I did it.
And I think that people can make their own judgments about that. But I have tried to be as transparent as I can.
DICKERSON: You talked a lot about transparency, that—when we think about trust—and there's been a lot of talk about that in your campaign and voters having questions. They have questions maybe related to this.
Trust and transparency are related. You have been transparent in the release of these e-mails, but what about before? Because there was a period where you held on to the whole kit and caboodle before any investigators were asking for it, long after you were out of the State Department.
CLINTON: Well, it wasn't that long. What I did was to send e-mails to people at their government accounts, which I had every reason to believe would be captured on the government systems.
And when we were asked to help the State Department make sure they had everything from other secretaries of state, not just me, I'm the one who said, OK, great, I will go through them again. And we provided all of them. And more than 90 percent were already in the system.
And, in fact, I gave so many that were not work-related, just to be as comprehensive as possible, they are already sending back about 1,200 of them.
So, look, I did what was, as I said, allowed. I said it wasn't the best choice. And it turned out to be a mistake, in retrospect. But, at the time, and given the fact that most of them were in the government systems, people are going to get a chance to see all kinds of behind-the-scenes conversations, most of which, I'm embarrassed to say, are kind of boring. [laughter]
DICKERSON: Just to button this up here, you have said you were sorry.
CLINTON: Yes.
DICKERSON: What exactly are you sorry for and to whom?
CLINTON: Well, you know, I'm sorry that I made a choice that has raised all of these questions, because I don't like reading that people have questions about what I did and how I did it.
I'm proud of the work we did at the State Department. And I'm really proud of all the career professionals I worked with. I'm proud of the people who came in with me. And we got sanctions on Iran, put together that international coalition. We got a new arms treaty with Russia. We did a lot of really important work.
And I want that to be the focus of what people know about my tenure at the State Department.
DICKERSON: Some people who know you and have worked with you say what this e-mail situation suggests is that there's nobody around you who can say, Secretary Clinton, this is a bad idea, don't do this.
Do you have such a person?
[crosstalk]
[laughter]
CLINTON: I have too many, actually. Look, this—this was...
DICKERSON: No, before the fact, not after. After, everybody is giving you advice.
CLINTON: I know.
No, but, John this was done by prior government officials, including...
DICKERSON: But not at this level, not solely a server just for you.
CLINTON: You know, look, let's—it was done by others.
And let me just say that, yes, when I did it, it was allowed, it was above board. And now I'm being as transparent as possible, more than anybody else ever has been.
DICKERSON: All right.
Secretary Clinton, we are going to pause right there.
CLINTON: OK.
DICKERSON: We will be back in one more minute with more from Secretary Clinton.
Stay with us.
[commercial break]
DICKERSON: We're back now with Secretary Clinton.
Secretary Clinton, Donald Trump had a supporter at one of his rallies suggest the president was Muslim and not an American. Donald Trump stayed mute and continues to say nothing about that.
Are politicians on the hook for every crazy thing one of their supporters stands up and says?
CLINTON: Well, of course not, because we all have supporters who may say things that we don't agree with.
But when you are at an event and someone stands up and says something like that in front of you, then I do think you have a responsibility to respond.
John McCain did back in the '08 campaign when somebody in one of his events said something similarly untrue and insulting about the president. And McCain stopped that person. That's what Donald Trump should have done.
And I said the other day he is fueling a level of paranoia and prejudice against all kinds of people. And when you light those fires, you better recognize that they can get out of control. And he should start dampening them down and putting them out.
He wants to talk about what he would do as president. That's obviously fair game. But to play into some of the worst impulses that people have these days that are really being lit up by the Internet and other conspiracy-minded theories is just irresponsible. It's appalling.
[crosstalk]
DICKERSON: Which Republican would you like to run against the most?
CLINTON: Oh, John, I have no—I have no vote in that. I'm going to run against whoever they put up against me.
DICKERSON: Are you doing anything to prepare for Joe Biden potentially entering the race? Is your campaign doing anything?
CLINTON: No, we're not, because this is such a personal decision.
And the vice president has to sort this out. He's been so open in talking about how difficult this time is for him and his family. And he's obviously considering what he wants to do, including whether he wants to run. And I just have the greatest respect and affection for him. And I think everybody just ought to give him the space to decide what is best for him and his family.
DICKERSON: Bernie Sanders has made quite a point of not attacking you. He said he's not going to run any negative ads.
Would you pledge to do the same thing with respect to him, not attack him, and also tell your supporters, hey, lay off?
CLINTON: Look, I want this to be about ideas and about policies.
I know Bernie. I respect his enthusiastic and intense advocacy of his ideas. That's what I want this campaign to be about. And I hope people who support me respect that, because this is a serious election. I obviously am running because I think it's better for the country if a Democrat who has the kind of approaches and values that my husband had and Barack Obama has follows this presidency.
DICKERSON: So, can I mark that down as a yes?
CLINTON: Yes.
DICKERSON: You will pledge not to?
CLINTON: Well, I have no—no interest in doing that.
DICKERSON: And you're going to talk about Obamacare this week, support it.
CLINTON: Yes, I am.
DICKERSON: What is the big new proposal you're going to offer?
CLINTON: Well, first, let me say that it's time that we say that the debate over the Affordable Care Act is over. The Supreme Court has twice upheld it, yet the Congress has voted more than 50 times to repeal it.
Let's get beyond that. Enough is enough. And we need to strengthen it, not scrap it. It is the core of how we're going to provide health care to Americans going forward, the 16 million.
But there are other benefits to it that people who are not on the exchanges are being able to take advantage of. You know, 158 million American women are no longer charged more for health care because of our gender. Young people can stay on their parents' policies until they're 26.
If you have a preexisting condition, insurance companies can't shut you out. We have a lot of positives. But there are issues that need to be addressed. I'm going to address them this week, starting with how we're going to try to control the cost of skyrocketing prescription drugs. It's something that I hear about wherever I go. It's part of the plan I will be rolling out in the next few days.
DICKERSON: Let me ask you about those Planned Parenthood videos. Have you watched them?
CLINTON: I have seen excerpts from them. And I have certainly read about them.
And what I am troubled by are the misleading, inaccurate allegations about them that we heard from Republicans at their debate. This is really an attack on Planned Parenthood, which provides a lot of health services, from cancer screenings , to contraceptive services, to so many other of the needs women have.
And to shut down the government, which some Republicans are advocating, over funding for Planned Parenthood, which takes care of millions of women's health needs, is just the height of irresponsibility.
DICKERSON: That's the policy debate this has turned into. But what was your reaction just when you watched them?
CLINTON: Well, look, as Planned Parenthood has said, these were misleadingly edited. They were intentionally taken out of context.
The fact is that, if we want to have a debate in this country about whether we should continue using—or doing fetal research, then it's not only Planned Parenthood that should be involved in that debate. All of the experts, all of the scientists, all of the research institutions, everybody who is looking for cures to Parkinson's, for example, should be asked, should we continue this?
But so far as I am aware, what they did, despite the way it was portrayed, is within the laws that were set up for this.
DICKERSON: This week, the Senate is going to vote to impose a federal ban on late-term abortions. Do you support a federal limit on abortion at any stage of pregnancy?
CLINTON: This is one of those really painful questions that people raise. And, obviously, it's really emotional.
I think that the kind of late-term abortions that take place are because of medical necessity. And, therefore, I would hate to see the government interfering with that decision. I think that, again, this gets back to whether you respect a woman's right to choose or not. And I think that is what this whole argument once again is about.
DICKERSON: In the politics this year, it looks like everybody wants an outsider. [laughter]
Now, that puts you in a fix....[crosstalk]...Does it put you in a fix? Tell us why it doesn't put you in a fix.
CLINTON: I cannot imagine anyone being more of an outsider than the first woman president. I mean, really, let's think about that.
DICKERSON: Now, I agree, but your name—we have not...
CLINTON: I mean, if you line up—if you—all these mothers and fathers bring me the place mats with all the presidents, and they bring their daughters, and they say, my daughter has a question for you. And the daughter says, how come there are no girls on this place mat?
DICKERSON: I agree that that is a difference.
CLINTON: I think that's a pretty big unconventional choice.
DICKERSON: Yes. But you know what I'm asking.
CLINTON: Well, I know you're asking, do we want people who have never been elected to anything, who have no political experience, who have never made any hard choices in the public arena? Well, voters are going to have to decide that.
DICKERSON: But they worry that people who are inside are too inside, that that's why the economic situation is tilted against the middle class. It's why they always feel like everybody can wiggle around the rules.
And that's something you have to deal with, right?
CLINTON: Of course it is.
And that's why I have an economic policy that is centered on raising incomes, because I think what we inherited from the Bush administration, what President Obama had to deal with had the potential of becoming a great depression, not just a great recession.
We have now recovered 13 million jobs, after losing 800,000 a month when he came into office. So, why would we go back to the same policies? Call them insider. Call them tilted toward the rich. Call them giving corporations a free pass to do whatever they want.
I'm against that. I have always been against that. I want to go back to economic policies where we create millions of new jobs and where people's incomes rise not just at the top, but in the middle and at the bottom, like they did under my husband.
So, you know, I'm not running for Bill's third term. I'm not running for President Obama's third term. But it would be really foolish of me not to say, you know, that worked better than what the Republicans offer.
DICKERSON: What role should Wall Street play in the economy?
CLINTON: Look, we need financial markets.
But they need to be put on notice that any of their behaviors that impact Main Street, that disrupt the kind of orderly processing of financial transactions because high-frequency trading is now going to be making decisions in nanoseconds, or fooling around, as they did in the '80s, in packaging mortgage securities in a way that really bombed us into the great resection, I don't think any financial institution, not just banks, because I think it's important to recognize there are a lot of financial institutions.
AIG was a problem. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. They were not banks in the traditional sense. We need to rein in the risks posed by these financial institutions.
DICKERSON: Let me—a final question.
Your friend the late Diane Blair wrote in her diary—quote—""On her deathbed, Clinton wants to be able to say she was true to herself and is not going to do phony makeovers to please others.""
So, knowing you don't want to engage in phony makeovers, give us three words that is the real Hillary Clinton. [laughter] Just three.
CLINTON: Just three? I can't possibly do that.
I mean, look, I am a real person, with all the pluses and minuses that go along with being that. And I have been in the public eye for so long that I think—you know, it's like the feature that you see in some magazines sometimes. Real people actually go shopping, you know?
DICKERSON: All right. Well, I'm going to have to really interrupt you.
Thank you, Secretary Clinton.
CLINTON: Thanks, John.
DICKERSON: Democratic presidential—Hillary Clinton, we hope to talk to you again soon. Thanks very much.
And we will be back in a moment.
CLINTON: Thank you.

CLINTON: Thank you very much.
TODD: And a reminder, I know there's all conspiracy theories out there, there are no limitations to this interview.
CLINTON: As far as I know. That's true—absolutely.
TODD: Exactly. So let's get that out of the way.
Let me start with a piece of sound, it's MEET THE PRESS, this is what you said on MEET THE PRESS seven years ago about transparency.
[begin video clip]
CLINTON: I want to have a much more transparent government and I think we now have the tools to make that happen. I want to have as much information about the way our government operates on the Internet. So the people who pay for it, the taxpayers of America, can see that.
[end video clip]
TODD: A year later, Clintonemail.com, this server—started private server. Had every government agency did what you did at the State Department there would be a lot of information that wasn't in the public. Do you see that now as a problem as far as the public is concerned?
CLINTON: Well, Chuck, let me make a couple points. First of all, as I have said very often, all of the e-mails that I sent were intended to be in the government systems if they were work related. That's why I sent them to people at their work a dresses. And, you know, the vast majority of them ended up there.
So I have said also that if I had to do it all over again I would have used a separate e-mail account. I did it for convenience and it turned out not to be that at all. But the bottom line is my e-mails were predominantly in the State Department system or on other government servers and then I said I'm going to give them all after a very careful review and I did so.
TODD: All right. I want to unpack a couple of things there but let me start with just the news of this week. You had said in a written statement under oath that you had turned over everything that you believed you had for the federal records with those 55,000 e-mails but we have now discovered an e-mail chain between then General Petraeus and yourself that took place a couple of months before these records started.
Can you explain the discrepancy there? It was the same e-mail address that you used while at state that you were using with General Petraeus just two months before you said everything was out there.
CLINTON: Well, everything that we had access to was certainly out there and the reason we know about the e-mail chain with General Petraeus is because it was on a government server. And so from my perspective we have a very thorough review process that we conducted and my attorneys supervised it, they went through everything and what we had available at the time was turned over.
TODD: But I guess what I'm trying to figure out is if you said in March that the e-mail system began in March of '09 yet but we have the same e-mail address popping up in January, explain that discrepancy.
CLINTON: There was a transition period. I wasn't that focused on my e-mail account to be clear here.
TODD: Let me stop you there. You say you weren't focused on it except this seemed to be—to put an e-mail server at your house is not a—it's a complicated thing.
CLINTON: Yes, but it was already there. It had been there for years. It is the system that my husband's personal office used when he got out of the White House so it was sitting there in the basement. It was not any trouble at all. I know there are a lot of people who are questioning that.
But the fact is that it was there. I added my account to it. It apparently took a little time to do that and so there was about a month where I didn't have everything already on the server. We went back and tried to recover whatever we could recover.
And I think it's also fair to say that there are some things about this that I just can't control. I can't control the technical aspects of it. I'm not by any means a technical expert. I relied on people who were and we have done everything we could in response to the State Department asking us to do this review because they asked all the former secretaries.
And the reason they asked, Chuck, is because they found gaps in their own recordkeeping. You know, my assumption—because this system was there before I became secretary—it was there when I left—my assumption was anything that I sent to a dot-gov account would be captured.
TODD: But, you know, that's very difficult to capture all of your e-mails by going to perhaps thousands of people and their dot-gov accounts. It would have been easier if it was sent to your dot-gov account.
CLINTON: Well, but when you communicate with people in other parts of the government you're not sending it to the State Department dot-gov and that would have been true either way. I think I have done all that I can to take responsibility to be as transparent as possibly in turning over 55,000 pages, in turning over my server and to testify on October 22, which I've been asking to do before the Congress.
TODD: You had said just now in one of your explanations that you provided these records because State asked of all secretaries of state. As you know there was a report earlier this week in the ""Washington Post"" that said that isn't quite how it happened. In the summer of 2014 they discovered the discrepancy with your records and they wanted to make a request then it became a formal request of the last four secretaries of state. Can you explain that discrepancy?
CLINTON: Well, we have explained that. The campaign has explained it.
TODD: What is it?
CLINTON: Look, when the committee—the eighth or ninth committee—investigating Benghazi asked for information from the State Department, they were doing a survey and they found discrepancies in their recordkeeping not in my records per se but in their overall recordkeeping. There were gaps and that's why they sent the letter and that's why we did the overall comprehensive search for everything.
And it got us to the same place—we looked through everything, we gave them everything work-related. In fact, we gave them so much they've already told us they're sending back 1,200 because they were clearly personal and not work related.
TODD: Can you respond to an alternative explanation that has sort of—
CLINTON: Another conspiracy theory?
TODD: That perhaps the reason you wanted to have a private server and not a government server is that Republicans have been coming after you for years, you might have—may have been running for president in the future and you wanted to make it a little more difficult for congressional investigators to subpoena your government e-mails and a little more difficult for Freedom of Information Act requests. Is that a fair theory or no?
CLINTON: It's totally ridiculous. That never crossed my mind. And in fact, since more than 90 percent of my work-related e-mails were on the system they are subject to FOIA or any other request. That's how the Benghazi Committee got the e-mails even before we went through our exhaustive process.
Now I have—as you're rightly pointing out—been involved from the receiving side in a lot of these accusations. In fact, as you might remember during the 90s, there were a bunch of them and, you know, all of them turned out to be not true. That was the outcome.
When I ran for the senate the voters of New York, they overlooked all of that, and they looked at my record, and they looked at what I would do for them and I was elected senator after going through years of this kind of back and forth. And it is regrettable but it's part of the system.
TODD: You know, one of the things about this over the last six months that I've heard from supporters is that there's an allegation about your e-mail server. The campaign provides an explanation, you provide an explanation. There's a new allegation, you have to provide a new explanation. There's an addendum that had explanation—it has the feel of a drip-drip-drip. Can you reassure Democrats that there's nothing else here?
CLINTON: Well, it is like a drip-drip-drip and that's why I said there's only so much that I can control. But what I have tried to do in explaining this is to provide more transparency and more information than anybody that I'm aware of has ever served in the government and I'm happy to do that because I want these questions to be answered.
I can't predict to you what the Republicans will come up with, what kind of charges or claims they might make. I have no control over that. I can only do the best I can to try to respond.
The Justice Department has the e-mails, they have the server. They're conducting a security inquiry. They will take whatever necessary steps are required to get this matter resolved.
TODD: Can you say with 100 percent certain that the deleted e-mails that the FBI is not going to find anything in there that's going to cause you to have to explain again?
CLINTON: All I can tell you is that when my attorneys conducted this exhaustive process I did not participate.
TODD: Why?
CLINTON: I didn't look at them.
TODD: I would want to know what e-mails. Why wouldn't you want to know?
CLINTON: I wanted them to be as clear in their process as possible. I didn't want to be looking over their shoulder. If they thought it was work-related it would go to the State Department. If not then it would not. As I just said, over 1,200 of the e-mails that we were overly inclusive in trying to be comprehensive the State Department has said we don't want these. These are personal. These aren't work related. They're sending them back.
So when that process finished, you know, my attorney said what do you want us to do with all these personal e-mails? I said I don't need to keep them. I don't need them or want them. So they then talked to the IT server, the technical people who were responsible for maintaining them and said we don't need them anymore.
That's the limit of my knowledge and I know I was a little sarcastic in one exchange with the press for which I—I'm sorry guys. But you know, I'm not a technical expert. I just said I don't need them. Whatever happened to them happened to them and I'm very sure that my attorneys did the most meticulous job that could have been done.
TODD: I'm just curious. Would anything having to do with the Clinton Foundation, would that have been personal or work?
CLINTON: Well, it would depend. I did not communicate with the foundation. Other people in the State Department did in accordance with the rules that have been adopted.
TODD: Any of these deleted e-mails are not going to be foundation related at all?
CLINTON: Well, there might be, you know, there's going to be a meeting or there's this but not anything that relates to the work of the State Department. That was handled by, you know, the professionals and others in the State Department.
TODD: All right. Let me sort of move on from that a little bit. I say sort of move on because obviously you've taken a hit in the polls.
CLINTON: I have.
TODD: There's the New Hampshire poll. Do you believe you have explained this and that there aren't any contradictions here? So is the issue not truthfulness but the issue of how you've handled it?
CLINTON: Well, you know, let me say this Chuck. I have tried to the best of my ability to be able to respond and if people are uncertain, if they have concerns about these questions around the e-mails it's their choice to say that's going to influence, you know, how I think about the election. I understand that, I get it.
But I also hope people will look at my life long advocacy for kids and families and women and look at what I'm proposing, the vision I have for the country to move forward on everything from raising incomes to equal pay for equal work to getting the cost of college down to dealing with high prescription drug costs—that's what I hope people focus on and people get to make their minds up. That's the beauty of our process. People can decide on whatever basis they choose.
TODD: Your distrust deficit—your husband did an interview on CNN and he basically put it all on the Republicans and a little bit of us on the press that this whole thing that has driven down your poll numbers. Do you bear any responsibility?
CLINTON: Well, first of all, I love my husband and he does get upset when I am attacked. I totally get that. But we also get the fact that, look, this is a contest and it's fair game for people to raise whatever they choose to raise. As he said I think in that same interview, they're not giving this job away, you have to get out there, you have to earn it. And that's what I'm trying to do.
And of course I take responsibility. It was my choice. It was a mistake back when I did it and I'm trying to do the best I can to answer all of the questions that people have. And as I said during the 90s I was subjected to the same kind of barrage and it was—it seemed to be at the time endless.
And then when I ran for the Senate people said, hey, we are more concerned about what you're going to do for us. And I trust the voters to make that decision this time around, too.
TODD: All right. I want to play a little comp we've put together of some of the positions where your positions have changed a little bit. Take a look.
[begin video clip]
CLINTON: So it is with conviction that I support this resolution as being in the best interest of our nation.
I've made it very clear that I made a mistake, plain and simple.
I believe that marriage is not just a bond but a sacred bond between a man and a woman.
This morning love triumphed in the highest court in our land.
We've not yet signed off on it but we are inclined to do so.
We're either going to be dependent on dirty oil from the gulf or dependent on dirty oil from Canada.
I oppose it. I oppose it because I don't think it's in the best interests of what we need to do to combat climate change.
[end video clip]
TODD: How do you respond to some critics who say your positions have changed out of political expediency? That you're sort of whatever the majority is at that time, that's the position you have.
CLINTON: Well, I just don't think that reflects either my assessment of issues and I don't think it reflects how people who are thoughtful actually conduct their lives. I mean if we don't learn, if we don't, you know, make decisions based on the best information we have available, well, you know, that's regrettable. And what I've always tried to do is just say ok, what is the best decision that I can think about making?
Now, with those that you did number one on the Iraq war vote, I've written about it, I've talked about it, I said it was a mistake. It certainly became a very clear mistake when you saw the way the Bush administration conducted that war and the decisions that they made. And so I have been very forthright in saying, you know, as I looked at what was happening it was a mistake.
On same-sex marriage, like a lot of people, including our president, I did evolve and I was not raised to even imagine this. And I'm thrilled now that it's the law of the land and I have a lot of good friends who are now able to be married because of the changes we've made legally and constitutionally.
When it comes to Keystone, you know, I was at the beginning of the process of trying to evaluate what was the best outcome. I did feel that I shouldn't jump in before the President and Secretary Kerry and make my views known because they're still in the middle of that process.
But it was frankly uncomfortable to have so many people asking me and my saying I'm waiting and waiting and waiting and it still hasn't happened. I don't know when it will happen. It may have to happen when I'm president, I hope. So I've said I'm against it on the total evaluation.
When I made that statement years ago we did not have the kind of energy profile we have. We did not have the full understanding of how the particular oil that would have been extracted from those tar sands was of a different degree of dirtiness and polluting in terms of greenhouse gases.
So I'm not going to sit here and tell people that I make up my mind—that's the Republicans. They make up their mind, they're never bothered by evidence.
TODD: But Bernie Sanders has been where you are on these issues. Bernie Sanders was there when it came to marriage 20 years ago. Do you think one of the reasons he's doing well right now is some progressives think, well, you know what? He was there when it wasn't popular.
CLINTON: Well he can speak for himself and I certainly respect his views. I can just tell you that I am not someone who stakes out a position and holds it regardless of the evidence or regardless of the way that I perceive what's happening in the world around me.
As I was saying, that's where the Republicans are. They're still believing in trickle down economics even though it was a disaster not once but twice for our country. So I want people—because I think my experience on these issues is much more reflective of how people talk to me about how they, too, have evolved and moved in their understanding and I feel very comfortable saying that.
TODD: Well, I have a lot more questions and the good news is I have a part two interview we're going to do for the new show, my new show ""MTP DAILY"". So we will get into some foreign policy, domestic policy, a bunch of stuff.
Madam Secretary, thanks for coming back to MEET THE PRESS.
CLINTON: Thank you, glad to be here.

18,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5000,"October 4, 2015","Interview with Al Sharpton of MSNBC's ""Politics Nation""",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111425,Hillary Clinton,"SHARPTON: First of all, thank you for joining us. What will distinguish a Hillary Clinton presidency if elected from a Barack Obama president?
CLINTON: I think where we are today is due in large measure to the tough decisions that President Obama had to make. I really like to take people back through the history and point out that, when President Obama took office, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, and we could have literally fallen into a great depression, not just a great recession. And because of the hard work of the American people and the president's leadership, we got out of that big ditch. So we are standing again.
But now we have to build on what we've accomplished. We have to raise incomes. People are not seeing the results of that recovery in their pockets yet and that's something the president and I have talked about a lot. We have to continue and win the fight to raise the minimum wage because it's disgraceful the people that work full time in America are still in poverty.?
We have to win the fight on equal pay for equal work for women. We have to incentivize more profit sharing so the productivity that leads to profitability doesn't just all show up in the paychecks of CEOs but is shared broadly. And then of course we have to continue the fight against climate change, create millions of new jobs from clean renewable energy and have an infrastructure program. I like an infrastructure bank that will put more people to work.
So we have a very robust agenda that builds on top of layers on top of the progress that we have made under President Obama. And the worst thing that could happen to our country, in my opinion, is for the Republicans to rip away that progress and to do a big U-turn back to trickle-down economics to slam the door in the face of hard working people, whether it's working women or minorities of any sort or the LGBT community, to basically begin to marginalize and you know, dismiss the contributions of so many of our fellow Americans.
SHARPTON: In 2008, president, now President Obama then senator Obama got 18 million votes. You did as well. What do you say to the eight million that didn't vote for you in 2008, why they should support Hillary Clinton now?
CLINTON: Well, they are coming to me. I mean, the amount of support I have from people who supported then senator Obama in my race against him in 2008 and then others who have been supporting him ever since is really very gratifying to me. A lot of people are very appreciative of the work I did as secretary of state. They view the fact that I joined the cabinet as the senior cabinet member for my former opponent which I think is what you're supposed to do in our country was a very important statement of values about who we are and our democracy and how we get things done.
So I think the number of people both in my campaign and on the ground, around the country who are supporting me who were first and foremost supporters of President Obama speaks very well to their understanding of how hard this job is and how they need to elect somebody, a Democrat, who can build on the successes of the Obama presidency, and that's what I am pledged to do.
You know, everywhere I go to speak around the country, I talk about the mess that President Obama inherited from his Republican predecessors, not unlike although much worse than what my husband inherited from his Republican predecessors. And what I say is I'm not running for President Obama's third term or for Bill Clinton's third term. I'm running for my first term. But I know what works and I know how important it is to stand up for our values, to stand up for our interests and our security in a way that makes sense which is smart.
So people who have supported President Obama are, you know, very enthusiastic and I'm grateful for that in support of my candidacy.
SHARPTON: The debates, the democratic debates s start on the 13th. How do you distinguish yourself from your opponent its, Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley without the theatrics we've seen on the Republican side. What is the distinguishing factors that you see between you and your opponent?
CLINTON: I don't think there's any comparison between, we on the Democratic side and the Republicans. All of the Democrats are saying is we want to continue to improve the lives of hard working Americans. And we have different ways of going about it, about how we want to make college affordable, how we're going to deal with the affordable care act. We have differences, and that's what the debate will be about. But what I want viewers and voters to understand is that the real challenges to the progress we've made are coming from the Republican candidates.
So whatever differences we have on the Democratic side, which we will be exploring in the debate to give people a chance to make up their minds among us, it is really not at all the kind of gulf between us and the Republicans.
SHARPTON: Any surprises that we can look for in the debate? Just between us.
CLINTON: Just between us, well, you know, I don't know. You never know. I'm going to start kind of getting geared up and getting prepared. There are always surprises. You never know what you're going to be asked. You know that so well. And sometimes in the heat of the moment you might not know what you're going to say, but I'm looking forward to it. I think it will be terrific for our campaign.
SHARPTON: There is always this looming question of whether vice president Biden is going to enter. Do you expect that he enters? And if he does, how will that, if at all, alter your strategy in terms of denomination?
CLINTON: You know, I have said repeatedly that this is a very hard time for the vice president for all the obvious reasons any of us can understand. And he has to have the space and time to make up his mind about what he wants to do and I respect that. I don't comment on it. I want him to do whatever he thinks is right for him and his family.
I'm going to run my campaign. I'm going to keep rolling out my policies. I'm going to keep standing up to the Republicans. I think they have really sort of showed their hand. They're really worried about running against me so they want to keep knocking me down. I kind of view that as a badge of respect actually, because they know that I will never give in to their, you know, very poor ideas about the economy or anything else. So I'm going to run my campaign and make my case to the American people.
SHARPTON: The fact that you are running and we are seeing different polls say different things, Iowa, New Hampshire, can you lose Iowa and New Hampshire and still win? Is there a path?
CLINTON: Well, that certainly has been the case in the past but I'm not going to lose. I'm going to work as hard as I can to make the case in the Iowa caucus and then in the New Hampshire primary. People didn't think I could win the New Hampshire primary last time after I didn't win the Iowa caucus.
It's very unpredictable. It is fast moving. But I think at the end of the day when I put forth, you know, my views about what the country should be doing and it is in conjunction with my experience and I think my ability, my determination, my tenacity to get things done, people will respond to that, caucus for me and vote for me.
SHARPTON: I'm going to say two words to you, Donald Trump. What do you think?
[commercial break]
SHARPTON: I'm going to say two words to you, Donald Trump. What do you think?
CLINTON: You know, Reverend Al, he has been stalking prejudice and paranoia. He has been really appealing to the worst instincts of human nature. I think it's dangerous, his demagoguery is no longer amusing.
SHARPTON: He called you shrill.
CLINTON: Well he has called me a lot of things. Now that he's running against me. Before he called me a great senator and great secretary of state. That's what a demagogue does, right? They say whatever they need to say to try to stir up the passions of people. So I hope that he is certainly, you know, someone who people begin to evaluate more carefully, but I will add this.
A lot of what he has said has either been echoed or not repudiated by all of the other Republicans. He may be the flamboyant front-runner, but his views on immigration, his views on women, his views on Muslims, his views on a long list of issues are not that different from the either stated or unstated views of everybody on the Republican side.
SHARPTON: Jeb Bush said in addressing an issue about why there weren't a lot of blacks at a particular gathering he was addressing, and he, among other things said, they were offered free stuff by Democrats, how do you respond to that?
CLINTON: You know, I find that so insulting, so demeaning and condescending, it's the kind of language we've heard not only from Jeb Bush, we heard it from Mitt Romney. We're hearing it from Donald Trump. It's insulting in the most fundamental way because when we as Democrats say, hey, we want equal pay for equal work, we want to raise the minimum wage, we want to make sure people get the best education they can, that college is affordable, that's to build people up. That's to give everybody a chance to be successful in America.
There's nothing free about that. That's the way we're supposed to be working in our country, where we want people to live up to the God-given potential that they have. And for Republicans to keep saying that, driving edges, dismissing the legitimate aspirations, the talent and the hard work of Americans or anybody else in our country shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what America is and should be. It needs to be rejected. I don't hear any Republicans rejecting it. But, you know, I had a Facebook Q&A a few days ago. I was just outraged about it. And I'm outraged again when you ask me.
SHARPTON: Let me bring you back. When you were a U.S. senator, you and I and others worked in New York around the [inaudible] case. And there are a lot of cases that has happened over the last year calling for police reform and calling for criminal justice reform. What would a president Hillary Clinton do to deal with the police reform question and to deal with the question that many of us are raising on how we have these matters looked at fairly and that families understand that they're getting a fair shot at justice?
CLINTON: Absolutely. You know, first speech I gave in this campaign was at former mayor Dinkins' Colloquium at Columbia University. And I addressed systemic racism and failures of our justice system, and called for body cameras on every police officer, called for an end to mass incarceration. And I am continuing to talk about the issues. And I think that President Obama's policing commission has a good set of recommendations that I would certainly urge that we follow and implement.
But it's bigger than this, Al. I mean, the real problems go to how we see each other, how we treat each other, whether we're going to get back into respecting one another and that's especially true when you have police who are warrant to protect certain communities and they don't listen to those communities. They don't work with those communities.
Now, the communities also have to respect the police. We understand that. But the initiative needs to come from changing a lot of the incentives in policing, changing the way police officers are trained, how they work. And I think with the policing commission that President Obama commissioned, we have good ideas on all of that, that shouldn't just sit on a shelf, we should be implementing.
And I think that to a great extent, the movement for black lives matter has been essential in raising up these issue. A new generation has come to the forefront. I've met with some of them, I've certainly been made aware of all the meetings my staff has been having with a lot of the advocates, because we have to restore fundamental faith in our democracy and equal treatment under the law. And we know that doesn't exist right now. And that's a rebuke to all of us. And I'm going to do everything I can to restore trust and confidence and respect by changing behaviors and by holding them accountable, you know. We need to make sure that the civil rights division and the justice department is fully staffed and able to provide a clear look at any issue that needs to be referred to the federal government.
SHARPTON: President Clinton, former president Clinton said at the NAACP that when he did the crime bill the Omnibus crime bill that maybe things went too far. And I remember as you know I was active then, a lot of people forget a lot of us wanted something hard because of limp bias and other things that were happening, crack, I was painting crack houses if you remember trying to expose them.
How do we deal with violence without adding to the mass incarceration? What would be the Clinton plan? We are seeing these shootings this week in Chicago.
CLINTON: Right.
SHARPTON: I mean, we've got to deal with this without feeding into where it went ""too far"" in the words of former president Clinton.
CLINTON: Well, both you and he are right. You remember what we were facing in the 1980s and the early 1990s. And people of color, poor communities, lots of towns and cities, including this great city of New York, were under tremendous pressure because there was so much crime, gangs were warring in the streets, crack houses were endemic, crack babies were filling, you know, the wards of our hospitals. And so yes, we did have to take action.
But let's remember some of the things that were done that we no longer do. We had a ban on assault weapons. I want us to get back to sensible, smart gun prevention of violence. I want us to have not just universal background checks, but I want us to really have the country rise up against the special interests lobby of the NRA that believes anybody should have a gun, regardless of their past history, regardless of whether they're domestic violence abuser.
This is just unsustainable, and we need to stand against it and I'm willing to take them on. Because I know that guns are at the root of so much of the crime and the danger that stalks our neighborhoods.
Secondly, we do have to weed out the most violent offenders, you know, the repeat offenders, the guys who have no regard for human life. But our prisons and jails are filled with people who have mental health challenges, people who have substance abuse challenges. They should not be in jail or prison. I want a much more robust diversionary program. I want us to do more on treatment. I think I may be the first presidential candidate at least in a long time who has a whole policy on substance abuse because this is at the root, you know. And so many people with anxiety, with depression, with other mental health problems, they self-medicate with alcohol and drugs, and oftentimes they get off track. We shouldn't punish them. We should help them.
I also think that the police have to understand that a lot of what we tried to do back in the day, back in the 1990s and the Clinton administration was to build those relationships between police and community, not to be in two separate camps but to be part of the same effort, to protect citizens, particularly the elderly, particularly the young, to have enough policing that people could feel safe, but not so much that it oppresses people and makes them feel that they are being singled out.
This is a hard path to walk, but I know we can do it. We've learned lessons. We have a lot that we now know especially when it comes to imprisoning low level offenders is not necessary to prevent crime on the streets. Let's focus on the bad actors that we don't want setting up crack houses again that you have to go and try to close or joining gangs that are so deadly people are dying across the streets in the country.
SHARPTON: Secretary Clinton, thank you so much for being with us this morning.
CLINTON: That went by fast. Thanks again. Good to be with you.
SHARPTON: Thank you. You and I work together on Sunday mornings usually in church.
CLINTON: That's right. I'm glad you're doing this early enough so people can watch before they go to church.
SHARPTON: That's right. Thank you.
CLINTON: Thank you.

He's from neighboring Vermont—the reviews obviously very positive from many pundits.
I'm wondering what the pundit in chief, your husband... [laughter] ... who was in Vegas, I'm wondering what he said to you after the debate.
CLINTON: He thought I did a really good job. And I think that's the highest praise that I can ever get, because there's nobody who—whose opinion on these kinds of things I respect more.
It was great to have him with me. We had just celebrated our 40th anniversary on Sunday last. So, the fact that he could come and keep me company and keep my spirits up and, you know, drill me on some of the things he thought were important meant a great deal to me.
TAPPER: As long as you bring it up, 40 years of marriage.
CLINTON: Forty years, Jake, 40 years. [laughter]
TAPPER: How—how—what do you know about him now that you didn't know 40 years ago?
CLINTON: I am so grateful that we have basically had the opportunity to grow in so many different ways.
I'm not going to sit here and tell you or your viewers that it's been a path filled with rose blossoms. It's been challenging. But, overall, looking back at those 40 years, I am so grateful that, after he asked me twice, I finally said yes and have spent these years with him.
TAPPER: Turning to the debate, you said at the debate that you're a progressive, but you're a progressive that likes to get things done.
Sanders has plans that I think might be fairly called more ambitious than yours, in terms of expanding Medicare for everybody, basically single-payer health care, free college tuition, an across-the-board expansion of Social Security benefits.
Do you think he's being unrealistic when he makes these proposals, in terms of what can actually get passed through Congress?
CLINTON: Look, I have the highest regard for Senator Sanders. And I think he is raising issues that the electorate, not just Democrats, everybody needs to be thinking about. And he has put forward his plans with passionate intensity. And I have put forth mine. And just think of the difference between us and the Republicans, who have put forth nothing but the same old out-of-touch, out-of-date policies.
TAPPER: But why are his plans more ambitious? Is it...
CLINTON: Well, his—he has a very ambitious and expansive view about what he thinks should be done with respect to free college and other of the policies that we both are trying to tackle.
I believe that my approach, for example, on college, I call it the New College Compact, because I think everybody should have some skin in the game, including students, who I say should work for part of their education. Maybe it's because I did and my husband did, but I think it's something that you want young people to feel really committed to.
It's a difference in approach. We will have an opportunity, as these debates go forward, to really dig down. And I'm hoping that whatever network hosts them, whoever the moderator happens to be, that they will really ask us to explain and contrast.
But it's a policy difference. I mean, you could see on that stage in Las Vegas how we are maybe approaching these problems with different solutions, but we're both seeing the pressures that American families are under and the challenges that they're facing that we want to try to address.
And the differences between us is nothing like the differences we all have with the Republicans. And I want the American people to be part of the debate, and to hear Senator Sanders' perspective and what he's proposing, to hear mine, to make up their mind, and then to remember that we're not peddling the same old failed policies of trickle-down economics and let the corporations do what they want and cut taxes on the wealthy, which is the answer to everything that the Republicans put forth.
TAPPER: Speaking of the next debate, you have said in the past that Vice President Biden should have—should take his time, whatever he needs, to make his decision about whether or not to run.
But your campaign is now signaling that it might be time for him to make a decision. Your top adviser John Podesta said this week—quote—""I think the time has come for a decision.""
Has the time come?
CLINTON: Well, that's up to Vice President Biden. Obviously, I have...
TAPPER: That's your top adviser.
CLINTON: Well, and I think what John was saying is that, whether you are encouraging or not, there does come a point where a decision has to be made.
But, certainly, I'm not in any way suggesting or recommending that the vice president accept any timetable, other than the one that is clicking inside of him. He has to make this decision.
TAPPER: At the debate, you were asked to name the enemy of which you were most proud. [laughter]
Among your answers were Republicans. That's about half the country, Republicans.
CLINTON: Well, it was a little tongue-in-cheek.
But it's clear, I think, to anybody who's been around for a while that, you know, they do seem to enjoy coming after me. But then, once I'm in office, they have always worked with me. And I expect it will be exactly the same.
It's funny to me. When I was secretary of state, I had very high support and approval from Republicans, not just the Republican voters, but Republican officeholders. As soon as I got into this presidential election, you know, all of that collapsed again.
And I'm just reminding people that, you know, you can be an adversary in politics, but then you do have to come together and figure out how to solve problems.
TAPPER: You're talking a lot at the debate and on the stump about further restrictions on gun ownership, gun control.
CLINTON: Mm-hmm.??
TAPPER: I remember, in 2008, during the primaries, you were positioning—positioning yourself to the right of President Obama, or then-Senator Obama, on this issue. You talked about respecting how guns are part of the culture, sending out a mailer criticizing then-Senator Obama for pushing tougher gun laws.
But now you're coming at Bernie Sanders on this issue from the left. Did something change, or is it just about who you're running against?
CLINTON: No, not at all. In fact, I would characterize what happened in '08 very differently.
I spent a lot of years in Arkansas. I have a lot of experience with and respect for people who own guns, collect guns, use them for hunting, use them for target shooting. I respect the Second Amendment. I was taught to shoot by my dad when I was a girl. I have gone hunting. I get that.
And I don't in any way want to denigrate those responsible gun owners, who have rights under the Second Amendment and our laws. But I believe we have gone way too far in being intimidated by the NRA. And I have said repeatedly that the majority of Americans and the majority of gun owners support universal background checks.
And for the NRA to take these absolute positions on behalf of the most extreme of their members and carrying water for gun manufacturers and dealers is just wrong.
So, I don't think I have moved at all. I do have more experience perhaps than some in living in places. I represented Upstate New York, which is a big, vast rural area with small towns and cities. So, I get why people who are part of gun ownership are very proud of that.
But what I don't get is why we can't have sensible gun safety measures to keep guns out of the hands of fugitives and stalkers and felons and people with serious mental illness and domestic abusers, the people who should not have them in the first place.
TAPPER: ""The New Yorker"" this week published a memo about you, about how to defeat you, by then-Senator Obama's campaign, including your current pollster, who I don't know if has talked to you about this. [laughter]
CLINTON: I haven't seen him. [laughter]
TAPPER: But, in any case, among other things, the memo said that you are driven by politics, not conviction, and you're constantly shifting, dodging and changing positions to satisfy the politics of the moment.
That's kind of the same rap on you from your opponents now. Do you reject it outright? Or do you see why some people might feel that way?
CLINTON: Well, I can see why people try to come up with ways of attacking me. That seems to be part of the landscape. It happened when I ran for the Senate. It happened obviously again when I ran for president.
But I have been the same person. I have the same values. I have the same principles. There isn't anybody, anybody that I know in politics who hasn't changed a position from time to time, except some Republicans who are impervious to evidence and changed circumstances.
So, I really don't pay much mind to that. I'm sure we had some memo somewhere pointing out things that we tried to go after. But that's politics. I get it. But I think anyone who looks at what I have fought for and stood for my entire adult life, on behalf of kids and families and women and the middle class and economic opportunity, knows that I have been very steady.
And, yes, do I look at evidence and try to figure out what's the best way forward to achieve the goals that I hold? Yes, I do, do that.
TAPPER: Speaking of politics, let's talk about the front-runner on the other side of the aisle, Donald Trump.
His daughter Ivanka just gave an interview to CNN. She said her dad—quote—""is not a politician, but he's really changing the dialogue and he's really disrupting the process in a very positive way.""
Do you agree?
CLINTON: Well, first of all, I have a really high regard for her. She is a wonderful young woman.
TAPPER: And a friend of Chelsea's, I think.
CLINTON: Yes, she is.
And I think what she said is borne out by what's been happening. He has brought his oversized personality and his reality television experience to the highest level of American politics, and seems to be getting a very positive response among a large part of the Republican electorate.
So, that's up to the Republicans. They have to decide if that will be their nominee or not. I have called him out on some of the things that he has said which I thought were uncalled for, some of the insults and the attacks that he's made on immigrants, on women.
And it's just unacceptable, what he let be said about the president. So, I'm going to continue to criticize him for going beyond the bounds of what I think is appropriate for anybody running for president.
[commercial break]
TAPPER: President Obama announced this week that he's going to go back on his pledge to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan, a pledge that you supported at the time. If elected, you would inherit 5,500 U.S. troops still in Afghanistan. Can you pledge that you would get all of them out of Afghanistan by the end of your first or second term?
CLINTON: You know, Jake, I think what you're seeing with President Obama is a perfect example of a leader who has strong convictions about what he would like to see happen but also pays attention to what's going on in the real world. And his decision is one that I agree with.
I will not sit here today and say what I would do upon taking office because, again, we want to bring our troops home. We certainly don't want them engaged in on the ground combat. We want them to help support and train the Afghan army. And we want them to, you know, continue to work with the government of Afghanistan to try to help strengthen security for them.
So, I can't predict where things will be in January of 2017. But I support the president's decision.
TAPPER: You're scheduled to testify before the Benghazi Committee in the House of Representatives in a few days. What are you expecting and how are you preparing?
CLINTON: I really don't know what to expect. I think it's pretty clear that whatever they might have thought they were doing, they ended up becoming a partisan arm of the Republican National Committee with an overwhelming focus on trying to as they admitted drive down my poll numbers.
I've already testified about Benghazi. I testified to the best of my ability before the Senate and the House. I don't know that I have very much to add. This is after all the eighth investigation.
Other committees of the Congress, standing committees with other experienced members of staff have all looked into this and basically just rejected the conspiracy theories that are still floating out there in some circles.
So, I really don't know. I will do my best to answer their questions. But I don't really know what their objective is right now.
TAPPER: I covered the Benghazi situation, the Benghazi tragedy when I was a White House correspondent. And there's something I just never really understood. And that is, why did the State Department deny all those security requests?
The former regional security officer in Libya, Eric Nordstrom recalled in testimony asking for 12 new security agents. And he was talking to a regional director who said he was asking for the sun, the moon and the stars. It got so bad, Nordstrom said, that he was fighting members of the State Department. It was like having the Taliban on the inside of the building.
CLINTON: Well, the accountability review board that I commissioned went into this in great detail. And they made some recommendations.
TAPPER: I know, but I guess the question is why, though? Why weren't the security requests, why weren't they made?
CLINTON: Well, that was left to the security professionals, Jake. And in the reports, the ones that have been done that were nonpolitical and independent in their efforts to try to sort this through, I think concluded that the security professionals in the State Department had to look worldwide and had to make some tough decisions. That's why we don't inject politics into it. That has to be what the professionals are deciding.
And there were a lot of different opinions and that's understandable. There's tough decisions that have to be made.
So, I can only point you to the very thorough review that several committees have done starting with the accountability review board that have gone into this in great detail and made recommendations about how we can better make those assessments. Not at the political level, because I don't think a secretary of state who may be there for four years or two years should be reaching down in and making those decisions. But we have to do a better job with the professionals charged with making the decisions so that the information can all be evaluated and the resources that are needed can be asked for and deployed to the best extent.
TAPPER: I know Bernie Sanders said that, quote, ""the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails."" [laughter]
But there are a lot of people who are not.
CLINTON: Well -- [laughter]
TAPPER: Including FBI officials looking into whether national security was compromised because of this server.
And this is something else that is very confusing to me. With all your experience, why wouldn't you anticipate that over the course of four years, handling very sensitive diplomatic negotiations, overseeing military interventions and surveillance, why wouldn't you anticipate that something classified, whether about North Korea or Iran or drones or an informant for the CIA, that it wouldn't be e-mailed to you? And why wouldn't you consider that having it on your personal account with some server in Colorado might be a potential risk?
CLINTON: Well, first of all, nothing—and I will underscore, nothing that I was sent or that I sent was marked classified. We have a system in our government, in our State Department, it was there before I came in.
TAPPER: Right.
CLINTON: It has continued after I left where there are decisions made about what is classified information in real time. And nothing was marked classified.
TAPPER: The inspector general of the intelligence community said some of this stuff contained classified information when it was generated whether or not it was marked classified.
CLINTON: Well, that is just a very strong difference of opinion. The State Department does not agree with that. And it is almost an impossible standard because we had two separate systems.
We had the unclassified system, so anybody on the unclassified system with the State Department would only be able to tell if something were classified if it were marked classified. We dealt with classified information on a totally different system. Nobody had access to that from an unclassified device.
So, I think a lot of this is being a public display of the very common arguments that go on between different agencies in our government. This happens every time there is a Freedom of Information Act request.
If something's going to be made public that was not classified at the time, maybe something has happened years later that there's a case and so now, it's sensitive information.
That's what's going on here. Different agencies are weighing in saying, yes, it wasn't classified, but we think that there is something in it that now we're going to say is sensitive. At the time there was nothing marked classified. And that is the fact that hasn't changed.
TAPPER: Right. And you said it was allowed too.
CLINTON: Yes, it was.
TAPPER: Who allowed it?
CLINTON: It was allowed under the rules of State Department. Again—
TAPPER: So nobody signed off on it?
CLINTON: No, no, it was allowed. You know, one of my predecessors did the same thing. Others in our government have done the same thing at very high levels, because the rules did change after I left State Department. But at the time and in prior years, the rules allowed it.
TAPPER: But it never occurred to you when any of these e-mails coming in from Sid Blumenthal with very sensitive information—
CLINTON: Sid Blumenthal was not a government employee or official. It would be like you sending me something, Jake. If I thought it had some interest to it, I might forward it onto somebody.
But I would not expect you to be in a position to classify anything because you were not in that classification process. Neither was he. So, he sent me stuff that he heard from people. You know, he's an old journalist and thought it was of interest. Some of it I sent on, some I didn't. I kind of made the judgment at the time.
It was not in the category of anything that could be classified because it came from an outside nongovernment person passing on what somebody told somebody told him.
And, look, I'm somebody who thinks the government and people who work in it should be open to getting information from different sources. I mean, you wrote a book about Afghanistan. If during the course of my being secretary of state, you had sent me an e-mail saying, look, I think the government needs to know this, and I thought, hey, that's a good point I'll send it on and six years later they say, oh, my gosh, he was reporting sensitive information. Well, you didn't know that. And I certainly didn't know that.
So, I think that this is a complicated issue for even sophisticated folks to understand. And I just keep going back to we have two different systems. I dealt with classified information very carefully and seriously.
I usually met with people to discuss it. It was delivered to me in hard copy so marked. And then when I traveled, I had one of those tents because we were afraid of prying eyes from certain governments that I would read classified material in. So, I'm very familiar with the importance of treating classified information as it should be with great care.
TAPPER: Can I get your e-mail address?
CLINTON: Sure. You want to send me something that might be interesting?
TAPPER: I'm just wondering for the future. I haven't had that kind of relationship with you, but if that was like a hidden offer.
CLINTON: Yes, sure. You can give me, you know, what you hear politically. I might make use of it.
TAPPER: Sure. Madam Secretary, thanks so much for your time. I really appreciate it.
CLINTON: Great. Nice to talk to you.
TAPPER: Congratulations on the debate.
CLINTON: Tank you. Thank you very much.

We met up with Clinton in the Granite State.
So, congratulations on this new poll number in New Hampshire showing that you're pulling ahead of Bernie Sanders in a state where you have lagged a little. He's from neighboring Vermont—the reviews obviously very positive from many pundits.
I'm wondering what the pundit in chief, your husband... [laughter] ...who was in Vegas, I'm wondering what he said to you after the debate.
CLINTON: He thought I did a really good job. And I think that's the highest praise that I can ever get, because there's nobody who—whose opinion on these kinds of things I respect more.
It was great to have him with me. We had just celebrated our 40th anniversary on Sunday last. So, the fact that he could come and keep me company and keep my spirits up and, you know, drill me on some of the things he thought were important meant a great deal to me.
TAPPER: As long as you bring it up, 40 years of marriage.
CLINTON: Forty years, Jake, 40 years. [laughter]
TAPPER: How—how—what do you know about him now that you didn't know 40 years ago?
CLINTON: I am so grateful that we have basically had the opportunity to grow in so many different ways.
I'm not going to sit here and tell you or your viewers that it's been a path filled with rose blossoms. It's been challenging. But, overall, looking back at those 40 years, I am so grateful that, after he asked me twice, I finally said yes and have spent these years with him.
TAPPER: Turning to the debate, you said at the debate that you're a progressive, but you're a progressive that likes to get things done.
Sanders has plans that I think might be fairly called more ambitious than yours, in terms of expanding Medicare for everybody, basically single-payer health care, free college tuition, an across-the-board expansion of Social Security benefits.

That's kind of the same rap on you from your opponents now. Do you reject it outright? Or do you see why some people might feel that way?

TAPPER: Stay with us. We're going to take a very quick break.
Coming up: what Clinton is expecting this week with the congressional committee she calls a partisan sham.
[begin video clip]
CLINTON: But I don't really know what their objective is right now.
[end video clip]
[commercial break]
TAPPER: Hillary Clinton heads to Congress Thursday to appear before the committee investigating the Benghazi attacks. I asked her about it in our exclusive interview.
You're scheduled to testify before the Benghazi committee and the House of Representatives in a few days. What are you expecting and how are you preparing?
CLINTON: I really don't know what to expect. I think it's pretty clear that whatever they might have thought they were doing they ended up becoming a partisan arm of the Republican National Committee with an overwhelming focus on trying to—as they admitted, drive down my poll numbers.

And why wouldn't you consider that having it on your personal account with some server in Colorado might be a potential risk?
CLINTON: Well, first of all, nothing and I will underscore nothing that I was sent or that I sent was marked classified.
We have a system in our government, in our State Department. It was there before I came in.
TAPPER: Right.
CLINTON: It has continued after I left where there are decisions made about what is classified information in real time and nothing was marked classified.
TAPPER: The inspector general of the intelligence community said some of this stuff contained classified information when it was generated whether or not it was marked classify.
CLINTON: Well, that is just a very strong difference of opinion. The State Department does not agree with that. And it is almost an impossible standard because we had two separate systems.
We had the unclassified systems, so anybody who was on the unclassified system with the State Department would only be able to tell if something were classified if it were marked classified. We dealt with classified information on a totally different system. Nobody had access to that from an unclassified device. So, I think a lot of this is being a public display of the very common arguments that go on between different agencies and our government. This happens every time there is a Freedom of Information Act request. If something is going to be made public that was not classified at the time, maybe something has happened years later that there's a case and so now it's sensitive information. That's what's going on here. Different agencies are weighing in and saying, yes, it wasn't classified but we think that there is something in it that now we're going to say is sensitive.
You know, at the time there was nothing marked classified. And that is the fact that hasn't changed ever since—
TAPPER: Right. And you said it was allowed, too.
CLINTON: Yes, it was.
TAPPER: Who allowed it?
CLINTON: It was allowed under the rules of the State Department. And again—
TAPPER: So nobody signed off on it?
CLINTON: No, no. It was allowed.
You know, one of my predecessors did the same thing. Others in our government have done the same thing at very high levels because the rules did change after I left the State Department. But at the time and in prior years the rules allowed it.

Thank you very much. [applause]
Thank you, Richard. And thanks for the great work that the council does under your leadership. It truly is an important resource for us all.
Fareed, I look forward to having the conversation with you, everyone here at the council, and Mr. Mayor. Thank you very much for being here and for everything you are doing and will do to keep our city safe and strong. I'm very grateful.
I wanted to come here to our city, which has shown such resilience in the face of terrorism, to talk about the events of the past week, and the work we must do together to protect our country and our friends.
When the United States was hit on 9/11, our allies treated that attack against one as an attack against all. Now, it's our turn to stand in solidarity with France and all of our friends. We cherish the same values. We face the same adversaries. We must share the same determination.
After a major terrorist attack, every society faces a choice between fear and resolve. The world's great democracies can't sacrifice our values or turn our backs on those in need. Therefore, we must choose resolve. And we must lead the world to meet this threat.
Now, let's be clear about what we're facing. Beyond Paris in recent days, we've seen deadly terrorist attacks in Nigeria, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey, and a Russian civilian airline destroyed over the Sinai. At the heart of today's new landscape of terror is ISIS. They persecute religious and ethnic minorities; kidnap and behead civilians; murder children. They systematically enslave, torture and rape women and girls.
ISIS operates across three mutually reinforcing dimensions: a physical enclave in Iraq and Syria; an international terrorist network that includes affiliates across the region and beyond; and an ideological movement of radical jihadism. We have to target and defeat all three, and time is of the essence.
ISIS is demonstrating new ambition, reach and capabilities. We have to break the group's momentum and then its back. Our goal is not to deter or contain ISIS, but to defeat and destroy ISIS.
But we have learned that we can score victories over terrorist leaders and networks, only to face metastasizing threats down the road, so we also have to play and win the long game. We should pursue a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy, one that embeds our mission against ISIS within a broader struggle against radical jihadism that is bigger than any one group, whether it's Al Qaida or ISIS or some other network.
An immediate war against an urgent enemy and a generational struggle against an ideology with deep roots will not be easily torn out. It will require sustained commitment in every pillar of American power. This is a worldwide fight, and American must lead it.
Our strategy should have three main elements. One, defeat ISIS in Syria, Iraq and across the Middle East; two, disrupt and dismantle the growing terrorist infrastructure that facilitates the flow of fighters, financing arms and propaganda around the world; three, harden our defenses and those of our allies against external and homegrown threats.
Let me start with the campaign to defeat ISIS across the region. The United States and our international coalition has been conducting this fight for more than a year. It's time to begin a new phase and intensify and broaden our efforts to smash the would-be caliphate and deny ISIS control of territory in Iraq and Syria. That starts with a more effective coalition air campaign, with more allied planes, more strikes and a broader target set.
A key obstacle standing in the way is a shortage of good intelligence about ISIS and its operations, so we need an immediate intelligence surge in the region, including technical assets, Arabic speakers with deep expertise in the Middle East and even closer partnership with regional intelligence services. Our goal should be to achieve the kind of penetration we accomplished with Al Qaida in the past. This would help us identify and eliminate ISIS' command and control and its economic lifelines.
A more effective coalition air campaign is necessary, but not sufficient, and we should be honest about the fact that to be successful, airstrikes will have to be combined with ground forces actually taking back more territory from ISIS. Like President Obama, I do not believe that we should again have 100,000 American troops in combat in the Middle East. That is just not the smart move to make here. If we have learned anything from 15 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's that local people and nations have to secure their own communities. We can help them, and we should, but we cannot substitute for them. But we can and should support local and regional ground forces in carrying out this mission.
Now, the obstacles to achieving this are significant. On the Iraqi side of the border, Kurdish forces have fought bravely to defend their own lands and to re-take towns from ISIS, but the Iraqi national army has struggled, and it's going to take more work to get it up to fighting shape. As part of that process, we may have to give our own troops advising and training the Iraqis greater freedom of movement and flexibility, including embedding in local units and helping target airstrikes.
Ultimately, however, a ground campaign in Iraq will only succeed if more Iraqi Sunnis join the fight. But that won't happen so long as they do not feel they have a stake in their country or confidence in their own security and capacity to confront ISIS.
Now, we've been in a similar place before in Iraq. In the first Sunni awakening in 2007, we were able to provide sufficient support and assurances to the Sunni tribes to persuade them to join us in rooting out Al Qaida. Unfortunately, under Prime Minister Maliki's rule, those tribes were betrayed and forgotten.
So the task of bringing Sunnis off the sidelines into this new fight will be considerably more difficult. But nonetheless, we need to lay the foundation for a second Sunni awakening. We need to put sustained pressure on the government in Baghdad to get its political house in order, move forward with national reconciliation, and finally stand up a national guard. Baghdad needs to accept, even embrace, arming Sunni and Kurdish forces in the war against ISIS. But if Baghdad won't do that, the coalition should do so directly.
On the Syrian side, the big obstacle to getting more ground forces to engage ISIS, beyond the Syrian Kurds who are already deep in the fight, is that the viable Sunni opposition groups remain understandably preoccupied with fighting Assad who, let us remember, has killed many more Syrians than the terrorists have. But they are increasingly under threat from ISIS as well.
So we need to move simultaneously toward a political solution to the civil war that paves the way for a new government with new leadership, and to encourage more Syrians to take on ISIS as well. To support them, we should immediately deploy the special operations force President Obama has already authorized, and be prepared to deploy more as more Syrians get into the fight. And we should retool and ramp up our efforts to support and equip viable Syrian opposition units.
Our increased support should go hand in hand with increased support from our Arab and European partners, including special forces who can contribute to the fight on the ground. We should also work with the coalition and the neighbors to impose no-fly zones that will stop Assad from slaughtering civilians and the opposition from the air. Opposition forces on the ground, with material support from the coalition, could then help create safe areas where Syrians could remain in the country, rather than fleeing toward Europe.
This combined approach would help enable the opposition to retake the remaining stretch of the Turkish border from ISIS, choking off its supply lines. It would also give us new leverage in the diplomatic process that Secretary Kerry is pursuing.
Of course, we've been down plenty of diplomatic dead-ends before in this conflict. But we have models for how seemingly intractable multi-sectarian civil wars do eventually end. We can learn lessons from Lebanon and Bosnia about what it will take. And Russia and Iran have to face the fact that continuing to prop up a vicious dictator will not bring stability.
Right now, I'm afraid, President Putin is actually making things somewhat worse.
Now, to be clear, though, there is an important role for Russia to help in resolving the conflict in Syria. And we have indicated a willingness to work with them toward an outcome that preserves Syria as a unitary, nonsectarian state, with protections for the rights of all Syrians and to keep key state institutions intact.
There is no alternative to a political transition that allows Syrians to end Assad's rule.
Now, much of this strategy on both sides of the border hinges on the roles of our Arab and Turkish partners. And we must get them to carry their share of the burden, with military intelligence and financial contributions, as well as using their influence with fighters and tribes in Iraq and Syria.
Countries like Jordan have offered more, and we should take them up on it, because ultimately our efforts will only succeed if the Arabs and Turks step up in a much bigger way. This is their fight and they need to act like it.
So far, however, Turkey has been more focused on the Kurds than on countering ISIS. And to be fair, Turkey has a long and painful history with Kurdish terrorist groups. But the threat from ISIS cannot wait. As difficult as it may be, we need to get Turkey to stop bombing Kurdish fighters in Syria who are battling ISIS, and become a full partner in our coalition efforts against ISIS.
The United States should also work with our Arab partners to get them more invested in the fight against ISIS. At the moment, they're focused in other areas because of their concerns in the region, especially the threat from Iran. That's why the Saudis, for example, shifted attention from Syria to Yemen. So we have to work out a common approach.
In September, I laid out a comprehensive plan to counter Iranian influence across the region and its support for terrorist proxies such as Hezbollah and Hamas. We cannot view Iran and ISIS as separate challenges. Regional politics are too interwoven. Raising the confidence of our Arab partners and raising the costs to Iran for bad behavior will contribute to a more effective fight against ISIS.
And as we work out a broader regional approach, we should, of course, be closely consulting with Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East. Israel increasingly shares with our Arab partners and has the opportunity to do more in intelligence and joint efforts as well.
Now, we should have no illusions about how difficult the mission before us really is. We have to fit a lot of pieces together, bring along a lot of partners, move on multiple fronts at once. But if we press forward on both sides of the border, in the air and on the ground, as well as diplomatically, I do believe we can crush ISIS's enclave of terror.
And to support this campaign, Congress should swiftly pass an updated authorization to use military force. That will send a message to friend and foe alike that the United States is committed to this fight. The time for delay is over. We should get this done.
Now, the second element of our strategy looks beyond the immediate battlefield of Iraq and Syria, to disrupt and dismantle global terrorist infrastructure on the ground and online.
A terror pipeline that facilitates the flow of fighters, financing, arms and propaganda around the world has allowed ISIS to strike at the heart of Paris last week and an Al Qaida affiliate to do the same at Charlie Hebdo earlier this year. ISIS is working hard to extend its reach, establish affiliates and cells far from its home base, and despite the significant setbacks it has encountered, not just with ISIS and its ambitious plans, but even Al Qaida, including the death of Osama bin Laden, they are still posing great threats to so many.
Let's take one example. We've had a lot of conversation about ISIS in the last week, let's not forget Al Qaida. They still have the most sophisticated bombmakers, ambitious plotters and active affiliates in places like Yemen and North Africa, so we can't just focus on Iraq and Syria, we need to intensify our counter—our counterterrorism efforts on a wider scope.
Most urgent is stopping the flow of foreign fighters to and from the war zones of the Middle East. Thousands—thousands of young recruits have flocked to Syria from France, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom and, yes, even the United States. Their western passports make it easier for them to cross borders and eventually return home radicalized and battle hardened. Stemming this tide will require much better coordination and information-sharing among countries every step of the way. We should not stop pressing until Turkey, where most foreign fighters cross into Syria, finally locks down its border.
The United States and our allies need to know and share the identities of every fighter who has traveled to Syria. We also have to be smart and target interventions that will have the greatest impact. For example, we need a greater focus on shutting down key enablers who arrange transportation, documents and more.
When it comes to terrorist financing, we have to go after the nodes that facilitate illicit trade and transactions. The U.N. Security Council should update its terrorism sanctions. They have a resolution that does try to block terrorist financing and other enabling activities, but we have to place more obligations on countries to police their own banks, and the United States, which has quite a record of success in this area, can share more intelligence to help other countries. And once and for all, the Saudis, the Qataris and others need to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations as well as the schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path to radicalization. When it comes to blocking terrorist recruitment, we have to identify the hotspots, the specific neighborhoods and villages, the prisons and schools where recruitment happens in clusters, like the neighborhood in Brussels where the Paris attacks were planned. Through partnerships with local law enforcement and civil society, especially with Muslim community leaders, we have to work to tip the balance away from extremism in these hotspots.
Radicalization and recruitment also is happening online. There's no doubt we have to do a better job contesting online space, including websites and chat rooms where jihadists communicate with followers. We must deny them virtual territory just as we deny them actual territory.
At the State Department, I built up a unit of communication specialists fluent in Urdu, Arabic, Somali and other languages to battle with extremists online.
We need more of that, including from the private sector. Social media companies can also do their part by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts, so they're not used to plan, provoke or celebrate violence.
Online or off-line, the bottom line is that we are in a contest of ideas against an ideology of hate, and we have to win. Let's be clear, though, Islam is not our adversary. Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism. The obsession in some quarters with a clash of civilization, or repeating the specific words radical Islamic terrorism isn't just a distraction, it gives these criminals, these murderers more standing than they deserve. It actually plays into their hands by alienating partners we need by our side.
Our priority should be how to fight the enemy. In the end, it didn't matter what kind of terrorist we call bin Laden, it mattered that we killed bin Laden. But we still can't close our eyes to the fact that there is a distorted and dangerous stream of extremism within the Muslim world that continues to spread. Its adherents are relatively few in number, but capable of causing profound damage, most especially to their own communities throughout an arc of instability that stretches from North and West Africa to Asia.
Overlapping conflicts, collapsing state structures, widespread corruption, poverty and repression have created openings for extremists to exploit.
Before the Arab Spring, I warned that the region's foundations would sink into the sand without immediate reforms. Well, the need has only grown more urgent. We have to join with our partners to do the patient's steady work of empowering moderates and marginalizing extremists; supporting democratic institutions and the rule of law; creating economic growth that supports stability; working to curb corruption, helping training effective and accountable law enforcement, intelligence and counterterrorism services. As we do this, we must be building up a global counterterrorism infrastructure that is more active and adaptable than the terror networks we're trying to defeat.
When I became secretary of State, I was surprised to find that nearly a decade after 9/11, there was still no dedicated international vehicle to regularly convene key countries to deal with terrorist threats.
So, we created the Global Counterterrorism Forum, which now brings together nearly 30 countries, many from the Muslim world. It should be a clearing house for directing assistance to countries that need it, for mobilizing common action against threats.
And let's not lose sight of the global cooperation needed to lock down loose nuclear material and chemical and biological weapons, and keep them out of the hands of terrorists.
At the end of the day, we still must be prepared to go after terrorists wherever they plot using all the tools at our disposal, that includes targeted strikes by U.S. military aircraft and drones, with proper safeguards when there are any other viable options to deal with continuing imminent threats.
All of this—stopping foreign fighters, blocking terrorist financing, doing battle in cyberspace—is vital to the war against ISIS, but it also lays the foundation for defusing and defeating the next threat and the one after that.
Now, the third element of our strategy has to be hardening our defenses at home and helping our partners do the same against both external and home-grown threats. After 9/11, the United States made a lot of progress breaking down bureaucratic barriers to allow for more and better information sharing among agencies responsible for keeping us safe.
We still have work to do on this front, but by comparison, Europe is way behind. Today, European nations don't even always alert each other when they turn away a suspected jihadist at the border, or when a passport is stolen. It seems like after most terrorist attacks, we find out that the perpetrators were known to some security service or another, but too often the dots never get connected.
I appreciate how hard this is, especially given the sheer number of suspects and threats, but this has to change. The United States must work with Europe to dramatically and immediately improve intelligence sharing and counterterrorism coordination. European countries also should have the flexibility to enhance their border controls when circumstances warrant.
And here at home, we face a number of our own challenges. The threat to airline security is evolving as terrorists develop new devices like nonmetallic bombs. So our defenses have to stay at least one step ahead. We know that intelligence gathered and shared by local law enforcement officers is absolutely critical to breaking up plots and preventing attacks. So they need all the resources and support we can give them.
Law enforcement also needs the trust of residents and communities, including in our own country Muslim Americans. Now, this should go without saying, but in the current climate, it bears repeating. Muslim Americans are working every day on the front lines of the fight against radicalization.
Another challenge is how to strike the right balance of protecting privacy and security. Encryption of mobile communications presents a particularly tough problem. We should take the concerns of law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals seriously. They have warned that impenetrable encryption may prevent them from accessing terrorist communications and preventing a future attack. On the other hand, we know there are legitimate concerns about government intrusion, network security, and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors can and would exploit. So we need Silicon Valley not to view government as its adversary. We need to challenge our best minds in the private sector to work with our best minds in the public sector to develop solutions that will both keep us safe and protect our privacy.
Now is the time to solve this problem, not after the next attack.
Since Paris, no homeland security challenge is being more hotly debated than how to handle Syrian refugees seeking safety in the United States. Our highest priority, of course, must always be protecting the American people. So yes, we do need to be vigilant in screening and vetting any refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security professionals, in close coordination with our allies and partners.
And Congress need to make sure the necessary resources are provided for comprehensive background checks, drawing on the best intelligence we can get. And we should be taking a close look at the safeguards in the visa programs as well, but we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and our humanitarian obligations. Turning away orphans, applying a religious test, discriminating against Muslims, slamming the door on every Syrian refugee, that is just not who we are. We are better than that.
And remember, many of these refugees are fleeing the same terrorists who threaten us. It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from ever finding new ones. We should be doing more to ease this humanitarian crisis, not less. We should lead the international community in organizing a donor conference and supporting countries like Jordan who are sheltering the majority of refugees fleeing Syria.
And we can get this right. America's open, free, tolerant society is described by some as a vulnerability in the struggle against terrorism, but I actually believe it's one of our strengths. It reduces the appeal of radicalism and enhances the richness and resilience of our communities. This is not a time for scoring political points.
When New York was attacked on 9/11, we had a Republican president, a Republican governor and a Republican mayor, and I worked with all of them. We pulled together and put partisanship aside to rebuild our city and protect our country. This is a time for American leadership. No other country can rally the world to defeat ISIS and win the generational struggle against radical jihadism. Only the United States can mobilize common action on a global scale, and that's exactly what we need. The entire world must be part of this fight, but we must lead it.
There's been a lot of talk lately about coalitions. Everyone seems to want one, but there's not nearly as much talk about what it actually takes to make a coalition work in the heat and pressure of an international crisis. I know how hard this is because we've done it before. To impose the toughest sanctions in history on Iran, to stop a dictator from slaughtering his people in Libya, to support a fledgling democracy in Afghanistan, we have to use every pillar of American power—military and diplomacy, development and economic and cultural influence, technology and maybe most importantly our values. That is smart power.
We have to work with institutions and partners like NATO, the E.U., the Arab League and the U.N., strengthen our alliances and never get tired of old-fashioned shoe leather diplomacy, and if necessary be prepared to act decisively on our own, just as we did it to bring Osama bin Laden to justice.
The United States and our allies must demonstrate that free people and free markets are still the hope of humanity. This past week, as I watched the tragic scenes from France, I kept thinking back to a young man in the world met in January after the last attack in Paris. His name was Lassana, a Muslim immigrant from Mali who worked at a kosher market. He said the market had become a new home and his colleagues and customers a second family.
When the terrorist arrived and the gunfire began, Lassana risked his life to protect his Jewish customers. He moved quickly, hiding as many people as he could in the cold storage room, and then slipping out to help the police.
""I didn't know or care, he said, if they were Jews or Christians or Muslims. We're all in the same boat."" What a rebuke to the extremists' hatred.
The French government announced it would grant Lassana full citizenship. But when it mattered most, he proved he was a citizen already.
That's the power of free people. That's what the jihadis will never understand and never defeat. And as we meet here today, let us resolve that we will go forward together, and we will do all we can to lead the world against this threat that threatens people everywhere.
Thank you all. [applause]
QUESTION: Thank you so much, Madam Secretary, and thanks to Richard Haass again, for organizing this extraordinary opportunity.
In the week of the Paris attacks, President Obama said that he thought what was needed now was an intensification of his existing strategy against ISIS.
Is what you're proposing an intensification of the existing strategy, or a change to it?
CLINTON: Well, as I said in the speech, it is, in many ways, an intensification, an acceleration of the strategy. But it has to also intensify and accelerate our efforts in the other arenas.
What we have done with airstrikes has made a difference, but now it needs to make a greater difference and we need more of a coalition, you know, flying those missions with us.
What we have done, with the president saying there would be special forces sent, it is right in line with what I think that they need to get there, and we need to take stock of whether we need more, and we need to also empower our trainers in Iraq to have more support to do what they're trying to accomplish by getting the Iraqi Army, once again, to be a fighting force.
And we need—one thing that I believe we haven't done yet is make it clear to Baghdad that we are going to be arming Sunni tribes and Kurds if they don't, because at some point, they have to be in the fight. The Kurds, as you know, are fighting bravely on both sides of the border, and they need the support that we've given them and some of the special ops work, and the assault and taking back of Sinjar.
And then, these other two elements that I mentioned. We have pieces in place, but I think we have to deepen and better coordinate, not only within our own country in Europe, but more broadly.
QUESTION: Do you believe that President Obama underestimated ISIS when he called it the J.V. team?
CLINTON: Look, I don't think it's useful to go back in and replow old ground. I think that, from the perspective of what they had accomplished at that time, even though they had seized and held territory, the major focus of our government was on trying to remove Assad from power, so that there could be a resolution, a political resolution.
And there were so many groups fighting. There were so many other factors at work. Now that ISIS has made clear that I think in part because they have been pushed hard by the airstrikes, by the Kurds, they're now expanding their reach so that they can keep their propaganda going.
So I think there's been, you know, an evolution in their threat and we have to meet it.
QUESTION: A couple of days ago, the New York Times had a headline that said, ""Paris Attacks Complicate Hillary Clinton's Alignment With Obama."" Has it?
CLINTON: Well, it's not the first headline I've disagreed with. [laughter]
Look, I—I have made clear that I have differences, as I think any two people do. I was very proud to serve as President Obama's secretary of state. I think we made a good team. We largely agreed on what needed to be done to repair our alliances, to get our country in a position to deal with the wars that had been inherited, and to take on some of the new challenges we faced.
But even when I was still there, which is publicly known, I thought we needed to do more earlier to try to identify indigenous Syrian fighters, so-called ""moderates""—and I do think there were some early on—that we could have done more to help them in their fight against Assad. But, you know, this is an evolving and fast-moving situation. I think we're all, you know, working to, you know, make sure that what we do actually will produce the results we seek.
QUESTION: When you were secretary of state, you tended to agree a great deal with the then-Secretary of Defense Bob Gates. Gates was opposed to a no-fly zone in Syria; thought it was an act of war that was risky and dangerous. This seems to me the major difference right now between what the president—what Obama's administration is doing and what you're proposing.
Do you not—why do you disagree with Bob Gates on this?
CLINTON: Well, I—I believe that the no-fly zone is merited and can be implemented, again, in a coalition, not an American-only no-fly zone. I fully respect Bob and his knowledge about the difficulties of implementing a no-fly zone. But if you look at where we are right now, we have to try to clear the air of the bombing attacks that are still being carried out to a limited extent by the Syrian military, now supplemented by the Russian air force.
And I think we have a chance to do that now. We have a no-fly zone over northern Iraq for years to protect the Kurds. And it proved to be successful, not easy—it never is—but I think now is the time for us to revisit those plans.
I also believe, as I said in the speech, that if we begin the conversation about a no-fly zone, something that, you know, Turkey discussed with me back when I was secretary of state in 2012, it will confront a lot of our partners in the region and beyond about what they're going to do. And it can give us leverage in the discussions that Secretary Kerry is carrying on right now.
So I see it as both a strategic opportunity on the ground, and an opportunity for leverage in the peace negotiations.
QUESTION: You talked about Arab partners, but it's worth noting that after having announced with great fanfare that they would join us in the strikes, Saudi Arabia has essentially dropped out. The UAE has essentially dropped out.
What would you—what could—can you do particularly to make these key Sunni states that seem more interested in fighting in Yemen, where they are battling a Shiite force, as they see it? What can you do to make them actually take this on as their struggle?
CLINTON: Well, that's—we did build that coalition with respect to Libya. We had the UAE, Qatar, Jordan involved in what we were doing on the ground, and it takes constant outreach and, obviously, you have to define the problem in a way that they see it as affecting their national interests. And you're right, the Saudis were actually involved in Syria and now have put all of their resources against the Houthis and the Iranian backers of the Houthis in Yemen.
Now, what does that mean? Well, it means that they see the battle that they want to fight as one against Iran and its proxies. My argument to them would be, left unattended, you could have Iranian reach from Tehran to Baghdad. If you allow Syria to fall into as terrible a distress as it currently is and basically Assad being a proxy for, a frontman for the Iranians, the Russians are interested in their naval base. And so you will find a consolidation of authority with the Iranians and moving into Baghdad even more so.
So what you're facing in Yemen could be a limited preview of what you could face going forward, unless we get some concerted effort to stop the fighting and to seek a political solution that does give some room to all the different groups within Syria to have a say in the future.
QUESTION: Donald Trump says that if you look back, you see that every time—I get a laugh just saying it...[laughter]... Donald Trump says that every time we deposed or encouraged the removal of a dictator in the Middle East, what has followed has been political chaos and a worse humanitarian situation than existed before. And if you look at Iraq, if you look at Libya, if you look Yemen, you look at the fragility of the Assad regime and what it has produced, isn't he right?
CLINTON: Well, he has a very short-term view of history, because it is not at all clear what the final outcome will be in the places that you named. As I mentioned in the speech, I spoke about the foundations of the region sinking into the sand just as the Arab Spring was breaking. And I did so not knowing about the Arab Spring coming to full bloom, but because it was so clear that what was being done by dictatorships, by the denial of opportunity, by the repression, by the sectarian divide just could not stand. It was going to explode at some point or another.
And with the developments in Libya, for example, the Libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want. They have not been able to figure out how to prevent the disruptions that they are confronted with because of internal divides and because of some of the external pressures that are coming from terrorist groups and others. So it's—I think it's too soon to tell and I think it's something that we have to be, you know, looking at very closely.
Now, deposing Milosevic left problems, but problems that we came at by having a deal—in fact, my husband's in Dayton today speaking about the Dayton Accord where people who had been slaughtering each other had to come together and resolve to exist within a government together. Is it perfect? No, but has it, you know, kind of going, and do we have some work to do there? Absolutely.
So, we have to look at all these different situations, I think, on their own as well as part of bigger trends.
QUESTION: Several of the people running against you against—against whoever the Democrat is, argue that—argue that we should not be taking in Syrian refugees, but we do, we should prioritize Christian refugees.
Jeb Bush has said this, Ted Cruz has said this. And the argument is that they are being persecuted, particularly harshly by ISIS.
Why isn't that right?
CLINTON: Well, I just don't think we should have religious tests about who we bring as refugees into our country. We've had—last I looked, more than 2 million refugees since 1990.
So far, we know that trying to do vet and understand the connections that a person or a family might have with somebody in the United States, you know, looking to see what organization, often a faith-based organization, will sponsor them and what they'll do to help them get education or a job, is by far the best way to sort out and to determine who should be included.
Now, this is going to take a long time, I mean, really doing this is hard under any circumstances. Doing it when people are essentially stateless, they don't necessarily have documents, it's hard to do the vetting, is going to be challenging. Which is, again, why I said in the speech that Congress should be providing resources for us to do it right, you know, not trying to stop it.
I just don't believe that's in keeping with our values or our history, and frankly it doesn't send the kind of message that we want to send to the rest of the world.
So, yeah, we have to be careful, we have to be vigilant and we have to have a system that does all of that.
QUESTION: Let's open it up to members of the Council.
Let me—if somebody wants to put up their hand, identify themselves, and please make sure it is a question, with a question mark at the end, and it be brief. So.
QUESTION: Thank you very much for your comments.
With respect to TPP, I would like to understand a little bit better why you oppose it, and what changes would perhaps make it acceptable to you?
CLINTON: I think—you know, there are two problems that I see with it.
One the final language of the treaty itself, which I don't think went far enough to meet the test that I've always applied to any trade agreement—I have voted for them and I have voted against them when I was a senator—does it help to create more good paying jobs in America? Does it raise incomes, does it advance our national security?
And I think there are enough unanswered questions. It was an—it was an extraordinary effort to try to bring these countries together to come up with an agreement, but I think that at the end of the day, for a number of reasons, including that they couldn't figure how to get currency into the agreement and it's only in a side agreement, I opposed it.
The other side of the coin, though, is we have been doing so little—because of Republican opposition, mostly, to better train and prepare people who have been, really, either sidelined or whacked up in—against their head by globalization.
Globalization is real, it's happening, it's having an impact. We don't have a good training program, we don't have the kind of support that people need to be able to move into positions where they can acquire new skills.
And I see those two things as going together because we have to first and foremost focus on how we better prepare more Americans to be competitive in the global economy, and I don't think we've done that. I want to see that done alongside any trade agreement to a greater extent than the Republicans have been willing to support it.
MODERATOR: Ma'am?
QUESTION: Madam Secretary, Amy Bondurant. So importantly, you've recommended that the U.S. lead the air coalition, and I wondered what next steps might be taken to ensure that that would happen.
CLINTON: Well Amy, there's nothing magic or easy about putting together such a coalition. I know President Hollande will be coming to the United States to see President Obama this week, and I assume that there will be a group of French officials, defense officials, intelligence officials, homeland security officials who will be meeting with their American counterparts. And on the defense side, I think that certainly the United States working with France and then from that, you know, sort of hub beginning to reach out to other countries to seek out support. And I would go back to Arab countries as well. So looking for a way to begin the discussions about the negotiations that lead to the coalition as quickly as possible.
You know, going back to Libya, you know, the Europeans were the ones who wanted American support, and we did not agree to do so until we had a very clear idea what they were willing to do. And then we reached out and worked with the Arab League so that there would be Arab partners as well, and that took weeks. It wasn't something that just happened overnight. But it is definitely doable if we begin, I think, with the French-American position and move out from there.
MODERATOR: [off-mike]
QUESTION: Terry Whitney, Castle. My understanding was with regard to U.S. support for Syrian rebels over the last year or two, one of the main restraints was that they could not fight Assad directly and that this was a severe limitation and part of the reason the plan didn't work. When you recommend supporting additional training for Syrian rebel groups, would you advise them to allow them to fight Assad, or is that a part of the conflict that we don't want to get involved in?
CLINTON: Well, back in the first term when Leon Panetta and Dave Petraeus and I made our recommendation about vetting and arming Syrian moderate rebels, the target was Assad, it was to defend themselves and be able to prevent the military taking over territory and creating the kind of humanitarian disaster that obviously we've all seen. So that was what we recommended back in the first term.
Since then, I know it's been a very difficult task for the—our government to take on and pursue successfully, but one of the challenges has been trying to draw lines, and you draw lines because you want to be able to vet and follow what happens to the arms that you are equipping people with.
But what happened to some of the few groups that have been trained is that they were quickly overrun by much more hardened fighters who were fighting Assad, so it was a—it was a very hard task to do, two or three years later. I think it might have been, but again, I have said many times, I can't predict sitting here what would have happened if we moved earlier.
It might have worked, it might not have worked. But you can't really take Syrians who are rebelling against Assad, and tell them they can't use their training and their weapons against the person who, as I said my speech, has killed far more Syrians than ISIS has to date.
QUESTION: Let me ask a follow-up on that, Madam Secretary, if the only way you can put together a moderate Syrian force is by having the United States cajole, bribe, arm and train it, we are then looking for this force to defeat ISIS, then defeat Assad, then defeat al-Nusra, then defeat other Al Qaida affiliates, keep at bay the Shiite militias and Hezbollah, take control of Damascus and establish a pluralistic democracy in Syria.
Isn't that kind of a tall order? [laughter]
CLINTON: Well, certainly, described like that. And that's why I focused on ISIS. I mean, because I think it's—I think right now, we have one overriding goal. As I outlined, we need to crush their territorial domain, and we need to try to secure the entire border between Syria and Turkey.
There is not going to be a successful military effort at this point to overturn Assad. That can only happen to the political process, so our efforts should be focused on ISIS, and yes, there are other terrorist groups, al-Nusra, whom you mentioned, is that particularly lethal fighter.
QUESTION: So, no fight against Assad for now?
CLINTON: There—we have to prioritize, and we had an opportunity, perhaps, I won't say that it would've worked. But right now, we've got the Russians in protecting Assad, the Iranians and Hezbollah protecting Assad.
We need to get people to turn against the common enemy of ISIS, and then we need to figure out how we put together a political outcome that provides enough autonomy, so that the separate communities within Syria will be able to re-create a Syrian state, even though it probably is unlikely it will be controlled by the Alawites from Damascus the same way it was before the civil war started.
QUESTION: There is policy here, but there is also politics. There are, inescapably, people trying to appear tough and tougher.
If there were, God forbid, another terrorist attack, God forbid, in the United States, do you think the pressure to send American troops into Syria would be unstoppable?
CLINTON: Well, it would certainly grow, but I think it would be a mistake.
Look, as I said, we should be sending more special operators, we should be empowering our trainers in Iraq, we should be, you know, leading an air coalition, using both fighter planes and drones.
We have a lot of work to do to be able to really decimate ISIS in Iraq and in Syria. But we've got to work with the Kurds on both sides of the border, we have got to figure out how to, if possible, have a second Arab Awakening in Anbar Province, get the Sunni tribes to feel that it is their fight again, as they once did.
And that requires a lot of political pressure being put on Baghdad. Injecting some large contingent of American forces complicates that, in my opinion. Right now, we need to keep the pressure on the people on the ground, and get them to change their priorities and work together.
MODERATOR: Final question.
QUESTION: Jim Ziren , Madam Secretary. Hi. Back to the no-fly zone. are you advocating a no-fly zone over the entire country or a partial no-fly zone over an enclave where refugees might find a safe haven? And in the event of either, do you foresee see you might be potentially provoking the Russians?
CLINTON: I am advocating the second, a no-fly zone principally over northern Syria close to the Turkish border, cutting off the supply lines, trying to provide some safe refuges for refugees so they don't have to leave Syria, creating a safe space away from the barrel bombs and the other bombardments by the Syrians. And I would certainly expect to and hope to work with the Russians to be able to do that.
You know, the Russians have, as you know, then I primarily focused on Assad's enemies and not on ISIS. I think that has changed, and there is an indication that has changed. After Hollande comes here, he's going to go to Moscow to see Putin, and I—and as I said earlier, I think getting Russia to play a role in that and getting Assad to understand that what happens to him will be a result of a political resolution, which Secretary Kerry is undertaking right now, but to have a swath of territory that could be a safe zone both for Syrians so they wouldn't have to leave but also for humanitarian relief. And I think that it would give us this extra leverage that I'm looking for in the diplomatic pursuits with Russia with respect to the political outcome in Syria.
MODERATOR: We can take one last brief question. Ma'am?
QUESTION: Thank you. (Inaudible.) My question relates to Saudi Arabia. Do you think that the goals that you outlined in the Middle East can be achieved without more cooperation from Saudi Arabia? And if not, how do you think [inaudible] can be convinced to change course?
CLINTON: Well, I think that that the Saudis are critical to achieving the goals, and, you know, the Saudis are now engaged in the discussions that Secretary Kerry is leading, they're in the same process as the Iranians, which is something that was hard to get to but finally achieved. And I think that the Saudis have a multiple level of responsibilities, first and foremost, stopping their own citizens from continuing the financing for extremists.
And, you know, Saudi financing is still a major source of revenue for terrorist groups inside Syria, inside Iraq elsewhere.
MODERATOR: Including—including ISIS, you think?
CLINTON: I have no evidence of that, but there—ISIS has become quite a self-financing terrorist network with their theft of oil, selling it on the black market with their destruction and seizure of antiquities, selling that on the black market, with their taking over Mosul and raiding the banks. They've got a source of funding, so I don't really know. But I know that the—that Saudi individuals have certainly funded other related terrorist groups over time and also exported a lot of Wahhabi radicalism by kicking out or sending out imams and teachers to set up schools and mosques to preach that particularly harsh brand of Islam.
So the Saudis have a lot that they can do to both stop and then to help. And that's why I said, look, they are legitimately concerned about a takeover in Yemen that butts up against their border.
And so, that is why they are expending a lot of money and a lot of military resources, trying to beat back the Houthis, trying to reestablish Hadian government. They have got a lot going on there.
But I would hope to draw them into a broader reading of what's going on in the region. And you know, for a lot of people, the Sunni-Shia sectarian divide is one of the major reasons for what's happening there.
It's understandable, but the Saudis need to have a broader view, and looking at Iran's influence inside Syria, their growing influence in Iraq as well as in Yemen, they need to understand they have to help us stabilize at least Northern Syria to start with, while trying to come up with some resolution of the Civil War.
And I hope they will be more willing to be involved.
MODERATOR: Madam Secretary, thank you so much for giving us your time. [applause]
CLINTON: Thank you.

22,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5000,"December 1, 2015",Interview with Charlie Rose,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111428,Hillary Clinton,"ROSE: She is a former first lady, a former senator from New York and a former United States secretary of state. Now Hillary Clinton is running for president. The Democratic frontrunner sat down with me for a wide-ranging conversation at the Hay Adams Hotel in Washington, D.C. She talked about her plans to fight ISIS and remove Syria's Bashar al-Assad, the challenges of dealing with Russia, with China and with the problem of climate change and this—the role of the United States in a rapidly changing world.
From a balcony overlooking the White House, she told me how she hoped fix the dysfunction in Washington and what being president is all about.
ROSE: There is the seat of power in America, the White House—Pennsylvania Avenue down the road. They seem to be in conflict. There seems to be gridlock. Can Hillary Clinton make a difference? Because Barack Obama thought he could.
CLINTON: Right. Right.
ROSE: And he didn't.
CLINTON: Well—
ROSE: I know. It's not personal with him.
CLINTON: Yes. Right no because—
ROSE: Because it takes two to tango.
CLINTON: He got a lot done, too, despite. Look—
ROSE: How is he going to do it, though? People want to say to you, how can you stop this conflict?
CLINTON: I'm going to get up every day and work at it.
ROSE: That's not enough.
CLINTON: No, it is true.
ROSE: It's not enough.
CLINTON: It starts with that—Charlie.
ROSE: OK.
CLINTON: It starts with that and it starts with once again, sort of nurturing relationships. You know, when I was first lady, when I was a senator and when I was secretary of state, I worked across the aisle all the time and sometimes there was only one thing that I could find to work with somebody on because everything else we were at odds over.
ROSE: So you say to those Republicans and you say to the new Speaker of the House—
CLINTON: Right.
ROSE:?—Hillary Clinton will be somebody you can deal with?
CLINTON: 100 percent.
ROSE: I'm prepared to reach out to you, I'll be down there.
CLINTON: Yes. Right. And I will do anything to find common ground but I will also stand my ground. There are some things that are not good for the country. I will not give in on those, but there is a lot of room here to find that common ground and we have to do it.
ROSE: Yes. But you know a lot of people think the biggest problem for America is Washington. That's the problem. And that's partly reflected in some of the politics that we're seeing.
CLINTON: Yes, that's true. But look at the way our founders set it up. They set up the separation of powers—
ROSE: Three branches of government.
CLINTON: And they made it really difficult to get things done, and some years it's really hard, and we're in one of these periods where we have a minority within the other party that doesn't believe in compromise, doesn't believe in reaching consensus—
ROSE: But there you go attacking them. That's not the way to do it.
CLINTON: No, no. No—because part of what you have to do is make it clear to everyone else who is in that party that there is room for negotiation. And those who do not even believe in the legislative process because they think that they arrived with all the answers and there is nothing that they can learn, maybe there is some ground.
I worked with Tom DeLay for heaven's sakes on reforming the adoption and foster care system because even though he and I were politically opposites, he cared a lot about foster kids and he and his wife had taken them in. I knew that. I cared about them. So we found that common ground.
That is just a 24/7 effort and I will put whatever it takes into doing it.
ROSE: Waiting for the plane to come down from New York, a very nice lady said to me, where are you going? I said, I'm going to talk to Hillary Clinton. She said ask her this one question for me. What can I do to make a difference? That was what she said.
CLINTON: That's a great question.
ROSE: And you must be finding that as you go.
CLINTON: I do.
ROSE: I would think running for president, and you've done this before. As tough as it is, as sleepless as it is, you get a sense to touch base with the width and breadth of this country. And you get a sense from young to old, you know, how they aspire for a better life.
CLINTON: Right. And, you know, there is something so intimate and personal about the encounters you have when you're running for office. I did when I was running for the Senate. I do now running for president. Sometimes just 30, 60 seconds people will look into your eyes and they'll say, ""I need help"", you know. ""My son is a drug addict and I'm taking care of his daughter, we have to have more help.'
Or the young man I meet who says ""I'm taking care of my mother with Alzheimer's. I can't quit my job but I can't afford a caregiver so I take her to work."" And I hear these intimate, personal stories. And it gives, you know, not only real texture to what I'm thinking about and what I'm proposing, but it makes it all real, you know, that there are real people out there doing the best they can.
And what can she do? Well, maybe there is somebody she can help, you know. Maybe there is a child she can tutor. Maybe there's a project to raise funds to send kids to college. Maybe there is just something she can do to contribute to the life that will be better for somebody else.
I say in my speeches, and I know it sometimes sounds a little corny, I say, you know, you don't expect the presidential candidate to say we need more love and kindness in America, but I'm saying it because I believe it. We've got to stop demonizing each other. We've got to stop with all of the anger and the terrible sense of alienation and division that is stalking our country.
We need to be kinder to one another. We need to put ourselves in each other's shoes and walk in them, if you can. So, yes, I mean being president is running the executive branch, doing foreign policy, working with the Congress, but it's also being a catalyst for people to feel that they can be their best selves and that we need them—
ROSE: And we're in this together.
CLINTON:?—and that's what I want to do. We're in this together. Absolutely.
[ROSE: This was the first major interview Secretary Clinton has granted since the terror attacks in Paris. We began our conversation with that tragedy and with her strategy to defeat the terror group ISIS.]
ROSE: Thank you for doing this. It's so great to see you.
CLINTON: Great to see you. Thanks—Charlie.
ROSE: This is the first conversation interview you've had since Paris. What's new? What did Paris change for all of us?
CLINTON: I think it forced a conversation that is taking place not only in our country and in Europe but in many places across the world about what are the opportunities and the dangers in this very complex time that we're living in. and specifically with respect to ISIS I think it has really accelerated a discussion about thousand world is going to deal with not only ISIS—how to deny it territory—but also with the whole network radical Jihadism which has taken advantage of that arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia.
And then I think finally how are we going to protect ourselves, our friends, our partners in a way that is in keeping with our openness, our values? And so I think it's really pushed all of these discussions that you have in the situation room, that you have in lots of places; but now it's pushed into the open and it's a matter of personal and political debate.
ROSE: OK. So with respect to the new urgency, what should the United States do and what would you recommend we do?
CLINTON: Well, I gave a speech about this.
ROSE: You did it at the Council on Foreign Relations.
CLINTON: Council on Foreign Relations because I think it's important that we look at it from a broader perspective. Number one, we have to deny them territory with a multi-pronged, multi-national effort, and the United States must lead that effort.
ROSE: What does that mean—lead?
CLINTON: Well, what it means is that we have to do the heavy lifting to get people to make the contributions that they have to make, whether it be aircraft to fly airstrikes against ISIS territory to go after leadership and economic infrastructure. Or putting together the troops on the ground, how we get more equipment and support to the Kurds who have been bearing the brunt of the fighting; how we do everything we can to get the Iraqis not only stand up their army but begin to work with the Sunni tribal leaders as was done successfully back in '07.
ROSE: And what incentive would you offer to the Sunni leaders to get them engaged on the ground so with the addition of American airstrikes you might wage an effective campaign both in Iraq and Syria?
CLINTON: Well nothing beats what was tried last time which was cash. Let's not turn our nose up at it.
ROSE: That's General Petraeus.
CLINTON: That's General Petraeus whom you recently talked with and was very straightforward and said, ""Look, we basically paid the tribal sheiks in Anbar"" and now we would probably continue that across the border into Syria to pull together a fighting force, and it works. And it worked, in part, because of revulsion against the predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq, the treatment of everybody at their hands, but it also worked because they were promised that they would have the autonomy and authority to make a lot of decisions within Iraq on their own behalf.
And unfortunately, Maliki and his views toward sectarianism slowly but surely undermined all of that. And now you've got the Sunni sheiks, the fighters on the sidelines or, even worse, some of them making common cause with ISIS.
ROSE:?—which raises an interesting question. Did we lose influence with the Baghdad government because we didn't have any remaining troops there? Would that have made a difference in terms of the behavior so that the Sunnis would not be so turned off by Baghdad?
CLINTON: Well, I certainly thought we should keep troops there. I advocated for that. The real problem was Maliki. He would not give us what's called a status of forces agreement that would provide the protections for American troops that we have to expect anywhere in the world.
And despite our best efforts, despite trying to negotiate and bargain with him, other members of his government, even the parliament, we were not able to reach that agreement. And the prior administration, the Bush administration had set a date certain for us to withdraw.
So in the absence of an agreement with Maliki, we had to withdraw. Now, that is what he wanted. I mean he made all kinds of promises to the administration which he did not fulfill.
ROSE: Was the absence of American troops, did it help lead to the strengthening of ISIS?
CLINTON: I wouldn't go that far. I think it was the collapse of the internal agreements. Our understanding was that we had help them build up a force that would respect Sunnis, that they would have a place in the Iraqi army, that there was going to be a national guard that would be created, that would, in effect, protect the Sunnis and give them some sense of, you know, autonomy, enabling them to protect themselves. And then, of course, the Kurds, with their ongoing arguments with Baghdad over oil distribution and autonomy.
So what Maliki did, and he was the driving force, was to begin to purge the army of Sunni officers, begin to take a hard line against the Kurds and their desire for more autonomy. And so, I really place the blame, such as it can be placed, at Maliki's feet.
ROSE: What should be the limits of our involvement?
CLINTON: Well, I think we have to look at this from several different perspectives. Number one, if we are going to lead a multi-national coalition, we're going to still have to take the lead in the air. That is our highest and best use. And even with France picking up at airstrikes, we're still, you know, carrying out the vast majority of them.
We also need to get those Special Forces that the President has authorized into the arena as soon as possible because they will be able to tell us what more is needed. And, in particular, how do we have better targeting on the ground. We want to go after the ISIS leadership, we want to go after their economic infrastructure—how do we really know what we're targeting?
ROSE: But General Petraeus, as you mentioned the interview, said to me that we should be embedding at the battalion level and not just Special Forces.
CLINTON: Well, we don't really have—I couldn't tell whether he was meaning the Iraqi army, if we ever get it stood up again. That's something we could look at. We have over 3,000 American troops in Iraq trying to do just that, working to essentially undo the damage that Maliki did to the army, try to return it to what it was when American troops left.
And I think that, you know, their main missions are train, assist and enable and if, down the road, it appears that we do get them up and willing to take the fight to Mosul and Ramadi and the areas that have to be taken back from ISIS inside Iraq, then there will be a role for Americans to perhaps be a part of advising those army units.
We're a long way from that. We don't—and from what I'm told—even yet have confidence that we could put them back into the fight. And at the same time, let's not forget what we were talking about earlier. We need to be building up a Sunni force, and that will have to operate on a parallel track to the army.
ROSE: But many people say we have been talking about this for a while, how do we get the Sunnis involved. There is a new urgency now—
CLINTON: Right.
ROSE:?—and a new emergency now.
CLINTON: Right.
ROSE: I mean tell me how serious the threat of ISIS is and at what level do we decide we'll do anything we have to do to stop them?
CLINTON: I think we have to have as our objective their defeat, so what is it you have to do to defeat them? And I think you have to fight them in the air, you have to fight them on the ground and you have to fight them in cyberspace. Now it seems to me there are people both currently serving and retired like General Petraeus who know a lot of the players. And we should be utilizing anyone who has that kind of personal contact because it's all relationship based.
We need people to go over there and look into the eyes of some of those tribal sheiks who will say you betrayed us, and we'll say, no, we didn't. When we left we had promises about continuing to pay the Sunni troops and continuing to have an integrated army. And we had promises. They were systematically broken.
So let's do this again right. You stood against al Qaeda in Iraq because you saw the damage they were doing to your way of life, to your people—the oppressive, violent approach that they took. Now you're facing an even more barbaric enemy which has more money and now controls territory. We need to get back in the game and we need to help you do that.
ROSE: Do we need to make coalition with Russia to do this?
CLINTON: Well, I think we need, first of all, to build a coalition of Europeans and Arab states. We have to work with—
ROSE: Don't we have that now?
CLINTON: Well, we have it, but I would say—
ROSE: And don't we see more participation by the British in terms of proposals to their parliament and the French are clearly energized.
CLINTON: Well, the French are energized. The Brits are still waiting to see whether they can be. We do have a number of our European allies who are flying sorties. The Arabs have kind of pulled back and we need to get them reengaged.
But with respect to Russia, I am not yet sure what exactly Putin's objectives are. We know that he has been bombing a lot of the opposition to Assad. We have to operate on two tracks at one time in a lot of what we're doing, as I just was saying in another regard.
When it comes to Russia, they have to understand that we are going to go forward with our multi-national, multi-pronged approach. I still believe a no-fly zone is important to try to provide some safe haven on the ground, taking back the Syrian-Turkish border is going to require Turkish help. It's going to require the Russians to be at least respectful of our efforts.
So we need to be engaged. We are engaged on a military to military—
ROSE: There is some communication between—
CLINTON: Absolutely.
ROSE:?—the defense minister and the secretary of defense.
CLINTON: Yes. And we have de-conflicted the airspace that we both are in, so we are not making the mistakes. But what they did invading whether intentionally or unintentionally Turkish airspace after having been warned repeatedly by the Turks—
ROSE: So what do you think?
CLINTON: Well, what I think is that they did.
ROSE: They invaded on purpose?
CLINTON: Well, no, I don't know—I said intentionally or unintentionally. But they were on notice to stay back. You know it's not—you can make a mistake, but they got so close that a mistake was possible or they just didn't care.
ROSE: so why did they do that? What is Putin trying to say to the world?
CLINTON: Yes, well, I think this probably was not something that came down from the Kremlin. You know, they want to go after those forces that are threatening Assad, some of whom are near the Turkish border. But by invading the airspace—and this is not the first time that they came close to doing it. NATO has issued a warning, the Turks have issued warnings.
It showed a disregard for the perspective of others, most particularly the Turks, that it's troubling. Now, I think they have been pushed back, and I think that we'll be able to have a more realistic conversation with them, which I would urge.
ROSE: But isn't Putin's interest pretty clear? He wants to be relevant. He wants to be a player. He wants to be part of the decision-making that takes place about Syria and he wants to say to the world Russia is important in the Middle East again—
CLINTON: Right.
ROSE:?—and he's accomplished that.
CLINTON: Well, he has certainly staked a claim to it. But whether he's accomplished or not is not clear. Because here's what also what has to happen—another one of these dual tracks there, Charlie. We need to get over the false choice between either going after Assad or going after ISIS.
ROSE: Yes. Help us understand that because everybody is talking about that.
CLINTON: Yes.
ROSE: How do you do both? Well, I think you do both by making it clear and bringing the Russians in. You know, The Russians have now paid a big price because of the bomb in their jet coming from Sharm el-Sheikh. So they've lost people to ISIS—right.
I think you say, look, we need, your if not your active help, your acquiescence in what we're going to do going after ISIS. So that means you're going to have to pull back from this area while we go after their leadership and their economic infrastructure.
But if you want to be part of that, we would welcome you. You have a dog in this hunt now because you're worried about what's happening in the Caucasus. You're worried about ISIS spreading its ideology.
At the same time we have to accelerate the political and diplomatic efforts and this is what Secretary Kerry is trying to do—in Vienna and everywhere.
CLINTON:?—in Vienna and everywhere and there has to be more willingness on the part of Russia and Iran to take a hard look at how we prioritize. Right now we're not going to see a military defeat of Assad. That's not going to happen. It might have been possible a few years ago. It's not going to happen now.
You're going to continue to see Russia from the air, Iran from the ground where Iranian soldiers are dying on behalf of Assad. You're going to see them continue to try to hold the territory they have and push back against the opposition.
So part of what we have to do is say, look, you've got to help us get to a political and diplomatic solution and you've got to either get out of the way or come on board with respect to ISIS, and we have to be very clear about that. And this should be a full-throated effort.
ROSE: And you have to convince Assad, who's your client almost, that your time is limited.
CLINTON: And that there will be a transition.
ROSE: Right.
CLINTON: Now, knowing the Russians and the Iranians who have a lot invested in Assad, this is a long process. It's not going to won't happen overnight. But if they will in their own mind, say quit bombing the people who are helping us fight ISIS, go ahead and put a cordon around the area that Assad still controls, protect him there while we do the diplomatic and political work.
ROSE: Someone people would like to ask you this question. I mean we had the 3:00 phone call during a previous campaign—what would you do. And so the question becomes, if there is a no-fly zone, which you're advocating, and the Russians invade that no-fly zone, would President Clinton say shoot it down if you give it warning?
CLINTON: Charlie—that would not happen because we're going to put up a no-fly zone where the Russians are clearly kept informed. I want them at the table. They don't have to participate in it but I want them to understand that there have to be safe areas on the ground.
If we can stop hundreds of thousands of more Syrians leaving Syria because they get to a place where they can get medical aid and food and the like, that's good for Russia. Why does Russia want this incredible burden that is going to be coming up through Europe and, yes, maybe they are happy to see Europe suffering like this but, in the end, it makes no sense for them and makes no sense for all of us.
And so I think you've got to have that conversation. Look, it's never easy with the Russians and particularly hard with Putin, but if you say, as I think you should and as I think the conversation needs to get to an operational level. And then, at the same time, a conversation with Putin about what our options truly are, I think you can say to him, we're going to put up this no fly zone. You will know very well where it is because it's going to be the same people who are working now to de-conflict airspace—
ROSE: Yes.
CLINTON: The same Americans you're dealing with on a mill to mill level but we have got to figure out how to keep more Syrians in Syria and frankly it's good for the fight against ISIS if we've got population that then can be a locus for that.
ROSE: A no-fly zone is one way—one place where you and the President disagree on policy with respect to Syria.
CLINTON: Right.
ROSE: Are there others in which there is a difference? We saw what you said at the Council on Foreign Relations. We saw the interview he did in Turkey. You seemed to be similarly responding to what the situation is. Where else do you differ in addition to no-fly zones?
CLINTON: Well, look, I think the President has said that perhaps we should have taken some additional steps earlier. But the real question is—
ROSE: That goes back to the point when you and Petraeus and others were recommending more in 2011.
CLINTON: Right, yes.
But now the important issue is what do we do now? And I think I'm arguing for perhaps a greater, quicker intensification of the work that I think needs to be done. I agree with the President's point that we're not putting American combat troops back into Syria or Iraq. We are not going to do that.
ROSE: Under no circumstances would you not do that?
CLINTON: Well, at this point, I cannot conceive of any circumstances where I would agree to do that because I think the best way to defeat ISIS is, as I've said, from the air which we lead; on the ground which we enable, empower, train, equip; and in cyberspace where, don't forget, they are a formidable adversary online.
So what I want to say is, look, we don't know yet how many Special Forces might be needed, how many trainers and surveillance and enablers might be needed, but in terms of thousands of combat troops like some on the Republican side are recommending, I think that should be a non-starter.
And it should be a non-starter both because I don't think it's the smartest way to go after ISIS. I think it gives ISIS a new recruitment tool if we get back in the fight. Whereas if we are equipping and supporting the Kurds, if we get the Sunni tribes back in the fight, then we can do a lot to make sure that works.
ROSE: Let me take you to another time—Libya.
You were a strong if not the strongest proponent of the U.S. and the French and others going to protect Benghazi at a time that it faced almost certain attack by Gadhafi leading to, as he said, massacre in the streets.
Was that a mistake when you look at what has happened since in Libya?
CLINTON: First of all, it's important to remember that the Libyans themselves held two successful free and fair elections. You know how hard that is after conflict, after 42 years when every institution has been hollowed out? The Libyan people rose to the occasion. They voted for moderates. Then, unfortunately, there was a lot going on in the region that was not necessarily in the control of anybody but which had a big impact on Libya.
ROSE: So I have two questions about that. First question is I think you were going to—I mean is there some lesson we need to learn and that may be applicable to Syria, don't get rid of a strong man until you have somebody that can come in there because you do not want chaos and you do not want the kind of circumstance in Libya because what you have in Libya now is an increasing force of ISIS.
CLINTON: Well, in one part of Libya. Yes, let me address that because it's a totally fair question.
Gadhafi had American blood on his hands. Gadhafi was a threat to the broader region. Our European and Arab friends certainly saw him as that and as you say he was promising to track down his own people and kill them like cockroaches.
My point was that with his demise, there was a coalition that rose up. They did hold elections. They were prepared to begin forming a government and there was a lot of pressure coming at them from extremists in all directions. And some of the old attitudes like the split between Tripoli and Benghazi; between, you know, east and west began to assert themselves.
I believe that right now there is an ongoing effort by the U.N. and others the U.S. is supporting to try to form a unity government, to try to get people once again to get back to working together. The problem, is we see advances by ISIS—they're not the only terrorist group—
ROSE: Sure.
CLINTON:?—but ISIS now claims that they have really taken control of Sirte, which happens to be Gadhafi's hometown. I think one of the ways we need to approach this is continue the discussions about national unity but, as a pre-condition, say we need to join together right now before they get a stronghold and work to eliminate ISIS in Sirte, and it is something that is going to require a lot of cooperation.
There are armed groups that are fighting for power within Libya that are not in any way identified with or allied with ISIS. They need to form even a loose confederation to try to push ISIS literally into the sea before they get a stronghold. There are a lot of other bad actors, don't get me wrong, bad actors who have taken up—
ROSE: But could this also be part of the way the President thinks about things now? I mean we go in with great intentions, we help participate in the Arab Spring. It was their revolt, not ours. And we end up with where it's not successful, democracy does not emerge and you end up with, in some cases, failed states or states that seem to be on the verge of becoming failed states. And, so, it's just not a place for America to be.
CLINTON: Again, I think it's dangerous to make these sweeping generalizations. Look at how valiantly the Tunisians are struggling.
ROSE: They're the big exception.
CLINTON: They're the big exception because they're a relatively small country and they've worked really hard to get everybody under a tent, so to speak, and get them organized.
Libya has pockets of functioning government, but they are not united, and it may well be very difficult to unite them because there has been historical rivalry between them. But we're talking about four years. You know we have a very quick time table—
ROSE: I know. We didn't create democracy overnight.
CLINTON: We did not, no. And nobody that I know relay has. That's not to say there is not dangers. And I do think if we could turn the clock back, if there had been a way, and we tried, to convince the Libyans to take more help, not just from Americans but from Europeans with whom they had preexisting relationships or even others that might have come to support them—the Scandinavians, for example—help them do more. They were so proud and they were so resistant to having security forces on their territory. They were even resistant to having foreigners come and help them figure out how better to run their oil industry.
They had a lot of really smart people who had been expats for decades, they came home and they wanted to do it themselves. If there had been a way that we could have better partnered with them, supported them, maybe it would have made a difference. But this is a long-term prospect that you have to be looking at.
ROSE: Speak to this. I mean we're looking at a world that's changing rapidly. I mean you've got China soon to become the biggest economy in the world and whatever their ambitions are. You have the Middle East which is close to exploding in some cases, some would suggest you have the Russians involved, you've got others involved.
How do we make our way in a sort of New World order and what is our role to do that?
CLINTON: Well, I think our role is to lead. You know, the absence of American leadership is not somebody else's leadership.
ROSE: But they say—let me interrupt --
CLINTON: Nothing.
ROSE: OK. But some argue that there has been a vacuum—that America has not been leading.
CLINTON: Well, then we should get about the business of leading. If that is a perception, we need to rid the perception.
ROSE: Who knows better than that than you? I mean there is a perception that we were not prepared to lead.
CLINTON: Well, look, I think it is a very—
ROSE: And a vacuum was created.
CLINTON: Well, I think it's a very complex set of circumstances, and it's important to look short-term, medium-term, long-term, right? I remember in some of the arguments I had in the White House over Mubarak. And you know, there was a lot of excitement about Mubarak falling. I was one of the skeptics, right, because what was going to replace him? Yes, had he been a heavy-handed authoritarian? He had. But what was the alternative? And I remember saying, you know, this may look great in 25 years, but between now and then, there is a lot of trouble for the Egyptians, the region and us.
And so I think you have to be constantly balancing what is the best decision you can make today, how do you think about what comes next, what are the consequences you're either trying to promote or prevent, and then what are the long-term challenges and how do we get prepared for those? I mean it sounds easy to say. It's very difficult to do.
And I think, look, when I became Secretary of State, Osama bin laden was alive and with his lieutenants plotting against us. Iran was on a fast track to a nuclear weapon. We had hundreds of thousands of American troops in the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan and our alliances were incredibly frayed, Charlie. You know, it's important to remember that, in 2009, our big challenges were seemingly as difficult as the ones we're talking about now.
So all these years later—
ROSE: Compounded by economic problems.
CLINTON:?—compounded by a terrible great recession that could have become a great depression. And so we worked our way out of that. I don't think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for literally saving the economy from a much worse fate.
Bin laden is dead. Al Qaeda is still alive. It's on, you know, maybe life support, but it's still alive. It's still kicking. It still is inspirational. We have to keep our eye on it. We can't just focus on ISIS. We have to be aware of al Qaeda's continue maneuvering.
We did reach an agreement that put a lid on Iran's nuclear weapon program which could have led to a conflagration in the Persian Gulf. Not maybe started by us but in which we might very well have—
ROSE: OK, but that did not speak to Iranian behavior.
CLINTON: No but—it wasn't meant to.
ROSE: I understand that. I understood that. I am not suggesting it should have been.
CLINTON: Yes, right.
ROSE: I am suggesting that Iranian behavior is going to be an issue for the next president.
CLINTON: Absolutely. And I've been saying this—again, I gave a big speech about what I will do as president and to deal with enforcing the agreement, because there are a lot of important details, and the Iranians have to know right from the beginning that they will pay a price, that there will be consequences for any misbehavior or breaches. And that we have to now turn our attention to dealing with their other bad behavior—still exporting terrorism, destabilizing other regimes.
So, yes, there is a bucket of problems that we have to deal with that the Iranians are posing.
ROSE: But how do we deal with those problems because they are part of—
CLINTON: Charlie, I would rather deal with those with the nuclear program.
ROSE: I'm not arguing about the nuclear—
CLINTON: No, but this is a big deal because what the nuclear program literally under lid, so to speak—
ROSE: Right.
CLINTON: Now, it's not so, you know, important that we stay as focused. We have to enforce the agreement but we're not spending all our time and effort dealing with their nuclear program which they really got under fast track when Bush was president and we had to deal with it.
Now we have to look at all their other bad behavior and we have to have the same kind of patient, strategic planning that went in to the agreement. You know, I started putting together the coalition to impose the sanctions within the first month of being in the secretary of state's office. It takes time.
I had to convince the Russians and the Chinese. I had to convince the Europeans, especially the southern Europeans to give up oil and gas from Iran.
This was a long struggle, basically, but it was diplomacy that was day by day which reached results. Now we've got to take a look and say, OK, what is it we have to do? Well, clearly, we've got to keep forces in the Persian Gulf. We've got to do a better job dealing with our Gulf partners who I think are very short-sighted in failing to cooperate with one another, to deal with some of the threats.
ROSE: Yes, but I mean for many of our gulf partners, Iran is the biggest enemy there is. I mean it's part of the Sunni-Shia split in the region.
CLINTON: Of course it is. Of course it is.
ROSE: And that's why they want to get rid of Assad who is supported by the Iranians as you know.
CLINTON: And he's an Alawites which is, you know, an off shoot of Shiism. Yes, we get all of that. But the good news out of the Iran agreement, as far as we know, they are not pursuing their own nuclear weapons right now. And that was a very real threat.
They understood that the agreement was better than they thought it would be, so they, too, can turn their attention to the rest of this bad behavior because what our big fear was, not only that we'd get a war over trying to prevent Iran from going forward with this program even if it was only two or three years, but that we would see a wicked race to proliferation in the Gulf.
ROSE: And this deal should stop that?
CLINTON: At least for the years that it's in effect, as long as we enforce it.
ROSE: This conversation part is about American leadership.
CLINTON: Right.
ROSE: You suggested over the weekend I think that America should lead at the climate conference in Paris.
CLINTON: Yes.
ROSE: How should America lead there and what are your expectations?
CLINTON: Well, I give kudos to the President. I think given the hand he was dealt by this congress and the difficulty in trying to come up with a credible plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our own country, he has played that hand very well. I mean a lot of the EPA moves, a lot of the Department of Transportation on greater mileage from cars and trucks and vehicles, I think he goes to Paris in a strong position to be able to say, look, we all have to come and agree.
ROSE: Right.
CLINTON: He also comes with a commitment for the United States to do more on innovation and moving more quickly toward clean energy, and he comes with the great philanthropic commitment of Bill Gates.
ROSE: Do you think he'll be successful? Yes, $100 million.
CLINTON: Yes, yes.
ROSE: You think so. You think we'll find some progress because there is a sense of almost the urgency that we are talking about with respect to the Middle East?
CLINTON: Well, in many ways, Charlie, I mean the Middle East is a terrible, complex human problem. And it drives you crazy because you keep saying to yourself, if these people would only stop this, they could build economies, they could have so much to contribute to the world. So you rack your brain about this.
Climate change is such a consequential crisis to everybody in the world. And it is a great shame to the entire human race, but particularly to the advanced economies such as ours, that we haven't made common cause to try to reverse or at least stabilize the temperature increase. And I'm really hoping that we get a good result out of Paris, and I think what the Chinese have done is really smart. You know, when President Obama and I crashed into their meeting in '09 in Copenhagen, they were not happy to see us.
ROSE: Where are the Chinese?? Where are the Chinese?
CLINTON: Yes. But they did agree to begin voluntary recording and accountability. Now they've come with I think a 900-page report and they've said look, we have a lot of work to do, because they can't breathe the air, their water is polluted. Their land is polluted. They have said, OK, we're going to deal with this.
But you know what the real trick here is? They're going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.
ROSE: Unless?
CLINTON: Unless we get there first or unless we are partners.
ROSE: It takes money as well does it not?
CLINTON: It takes money but they're going to—they're going to make big investments—
ROSE: Innovation and creativity.
CLINTON:?—in solar, in wind, and everything else. And then they're going to be exporting and they're going to be controlling that market unless we understand there is a huge economic opportunity that goes hand in hand with climate change.
ROSE: Let me ask you about trade, too.
CLINTON: Yes.
ROSE: I mean how important—we have a vote coming up in Congress.
CLINTON: Right.
ROSE: Would you encourage—I mean trade is an important aspect. You were very strongly in favor of the trade agreement.
CLINTON: Well, I was in favor of the high hopes and standards for it. Right.
ROSE: That's fair enough.
You understand the importance of trade.
CLINTON: Yes, of course I do. We're 5 percent of the world's population. If we're going to grow, we have to sell to the other 95 percent. I absolutely understand that.
But here are two problems. One, I've had the same criteria for judging trade agreements for years. I voted for some and I voted against a big multi-national one when I was in the senate.
ROSE: But you were really in favor of this one?
CLINTON: No. It hadn't even been negotiated.
ROSE: That's the impression though as you know.
CLINTON: Well, I can't help what impressions are. What I said from the beginning is it has to produce more good paying jobs for Americans. It has to raise Americans' wages and it has to be in furtherance of our national security. So when it came out, you know, none of us saw the details until it was actually produced some few months ago.
In my opinion, it didn't meet those standards. And so I said I'm against it. Now, I'm not against all trade, but I am against certain provisions of this, including the failure to integrate currency manipulation into the enforceable body of the agreement.
But there is another point I just want to quickly make which is, you know, the Republicans are always for every trade agreement. Trade if it's going to be successful for the American worker, the American business, has to be more than just special deals for giant multi-national corporations who have some linkage to America.
And the Republicans have blocked every effort to raise the minimum wage, better training, apprenticeship programs, make education more affordable. They have blocked every effort to try to make sure American workers were as prepared as possible to compete and win in the global economy.
So, for me, the trade agreement on the merits is not one I can support and the failure to kind of make the other side of the equation fair so that more Americans will get the skills they need to be able to compete, you know, just makes it a decision that I'm not ready to take now.
ROSE: Would you encourage Democratic members of the Congress to vote against it?
CLINTON: I have stated my position, you know. If anybody wants to talk to me, they're welcome to call me but I have stated my position and I will let the Congress work its will.
ROSE: You announced a significant idea about infrastructure.
CLINTON: Right.
ROSE: Why has it taken this country so long to deal with infrastructure? What's the problem?
CLINTON: Well, the problem Charlie is that the Republicans don't want to pay for anything. You know, when I was in the Senate, I was on the committee that was responsible for writing the bill, the Highway Transportation Bill. It was hard because we had a lot of back and forth, but we came out with a bill, we got it done.
There has not been a bill that has actually come out for years now. And, so the congress is in the middle of arguing about whether or not they can get a highway bill. But they don't want anybody to pay anything for it. And so, they don't want to use user fees. They don't want any kind of fee that could be construed as a tax, OK.
[crosstalk]
CLINTON: At some point, you know, we are crumbling. I mean every independent assessment says the same thing. We have a failing grade or maybe at the most a D-minus—
ROSE: And putting our citizens at risk.
CLINTON: Well, and costing the money. You know, in a lot of places in this country, people pay a lot to fix axles and wheels and other things that are damaged by potted and deteriorating roads. We have a lot of bridges that if you had a choice you wouldn't cross because they're not in good shape.
Our airports—we don't have a single airport in the top 20 airports in the entire world. The closest we get is Cincinnati at 30. I mean we have watched over deterioration, to say nothing of what you can't see. Under the ground, you know, in New York we have water mains and sewer mains and gas lines—some of them are blowing up and some of them are cracking.
ROSE: So did we miss an opportunity during the first four years of the Obama administration to do more?
CLINTON: Well, we did as much as the Congress would let the administration do. The Recovery Act had ""Build America"" bonds. They had money going in to all kinds of construction. We could have done a lot more and we would be better off if we had.
ROSE: This campaign is about middle class economic future.
CLINTON: Right, right.
ROSE: Do you recommend cutting middle class taxes?
CLINTON: Well, not raising them, certainly.
ROSE: No, but didn't you say you're in favor of cutting them?
CLINTON: Well, I'm in favor of giving specific tax credits and breaks so that middle class families can meet some of their obligations. So for example, you know, more help on childcare, more help on care giving like taking care of an elderly relative with Alzheimer's. Making sure we keep tax credits for education.
So in effect those are cutting taxes—not an across-the-board cut. They are tied to certain activities, you know, activities or services that middle class people need.
ROSE: But do you also urge raising income taxes on wealthy individuals?
CLINTON: On you and me? Yes.
ROSE: Yes. You and I'm included. True
CLINTON: Sorry.
ROSE: And I'm willing.
CLINTON: Yes. No, really.
I mean it is—the tax system truly is stacked for those on the top, and it is something that breeds so much resentment and grievance on the part of small businesses, on the part of hard-working people and, you know, the wealthy pay too little and middle class people pay too much and we've got to get a better balance.
We do need revenues. I'm not somebody who says we don't. I just want to start with the people who actually can contribute more and make the tax system fair in the process.
ROSE: And what about corporate tax?
CLINTON: We're going to have to take a hard look at it because right now we have a very high rate but the effective rate hardly ever reaches that.
ROSE: I know. There is over 35 percent. At the same time, I think the average is about 18 or 20 percent.
CLINTON: Yes. And some get away with nothing.
ROSE: Yes.
CLINTON: And so—look, I don't want to stifle American entrepreneurialism. I don't want to stifle American business, but I want to change the incentives. That's why when I rolled out my economic plans I said, look, I want strong growth, fair growth and long-term growth. And the long-term growth may be the most important piece.
I'll tell you just a very quick story. There was a survey done where CEOs of major American corporations were asked this question. If you knew an investment you could make today would pay off down the road by investing in plant and equipment, research and experimentation or worker training, but it would knock a penny off your share price, would you do it? And to a person, they said, no, we can't, we can't do it.
I actually called up someone we both know to say, seriously? Absolutely. It makes me sick to say was the response, but, no, we can't, we will get hammered, we will be putting a big target on our chest for the activist shareholders. We can't do it. Now, we must change those incentives. We need more patient capital. We need more investments at home.
ROSE: How about payroll tax.
CLINTON: Well, you know, the payroll taxes—
ROSE: I don't know—what?
CLINTON: I don't think it's that big a deal.
ROSE: Is that right?
CLINTON: No because, you know, President Obama suspended it, nobody even noticed because we have to fund social security. That's a different issue.
ROSE: Wouldn't that put money in the pockets right away of the middle class?
CLINTON: It did but it wasn't—it was not something that people really valued if you—from what I—
ROSE: Politically or economically?
CLINTON: Apparently both from the research that I've seen.
ROSE: Speaking of corporations.
Pfizer, Allergan—merger, move to Ireland, reduce your tax rate.
CLINTON: Right. Right.
ROSE: They say, meaning they will be able to have more money to spend because they're not paying big taxes to develop new drugs. They say it's in the interest of the public.
CLINTON: I never know what to make of these kinds of comments. Personally, I was deeply distressed by the Pfizer decision. And I know, for instance, that drug companies spend more money on advertising than they do on research in our country. And so when they say, oh, we're going to be able to spend more money on research, I would love to know the numbers. I find that hard to buy.
I think there is a certain gamesmanship associated with it which I find really regrettable, you know. It's, like, OK, if we can beat the system—and Ireland has had this big welcome sign, you know, we're going to go down as low as we can—
ROSE: Right.
CLINTON:?—I mean the rest of Europe is annoyed, the United States is annoyed, but I don't think inversions should be legal and I know that the Justice Department and Treasury Department have looked at those. I don't think they should be.
ROSE: The President said they're unpatriotic.
CLINTON: Well, they are. I mean truly, when you think about it, I mean Pfizer is a New York company. That's where its roots have been. And obviously, as time went by, it employed fewer people but it's always been an American flagship company.
And for them to say, you know, this is just really a game—because if you listen to it, you know, how many executives are actually going to move to Dublin? No, they're going to move virtually. They're going to move, you know, the button you press on your computer to say this is where intellectual property now lives, you know, apparently in a castle outside of Dublin.
ROSE: They're not going to pick up their factories and go—
CLINTON: Well no. They don't have that many left and I'm sure they have a global reach on that. But it's really a kick in the teeth. I mean this country has done more to inspire this kind of innovation than any place in the world.
ROSE: OK. But you have a lot of companies like Apple, for example, have a lot of money overseas.
CLINTON: Right.
ROSE: And they say, you know, make it more—give us some amnesty, do something, and we'll bring that money home. What would you say?
CLINTON: We'll have to look at all of that. I mean yes. But let me tell you—we did repatriate when I was in the Senate, OK, under George W. Bush. We repatriated, they said the same thing to us. And I know I had a parade of people coming in—CEOs and CFOs saying we really need to do this and when we get the money back, we're going to do x, y, z. And what did they do? They bought back shares. They increased the dividends—
ROSE: And stock price—stock prices were up.
CLINTON:?—and they put more money into CEO pay and bonus. George W. Bush is on record as saying he would never have supported at the end because they all lied us to. So if we're going to do a repatriation, it's going to have to be rock solid and very clear about where that money goes and what it's used for.
Now, I think we have to look at the entire corporate code. I don't want to preside over an exodus of American companies. I want people coming here to invest. I want people, you know, building the next generation of whatever it is—clean energy, technology, you name it.
So I want to be a good president for business, but I also want to be a good president for everybody in America, not just for, you know, CEOs and activist shareholders.
ROSE: Have you suffered from the fact that they say you're too close to Wall Street? Has that hurt your image, in your judgment, running for president?
CLINTON: I don't think so. I mean look—
ROSE: Not in favor of corporate regulations as she should be, says Elizabeth Warren.
CLINTON: Well, all I know is that it was in 2007 that I called out Wall Street on the use of securities to, you know, play the mortgage market and called them out on the hedge fund loophole for carried interest.
I have been very outspoken on this. And I have stood for a lot of regulation on big banks and on the financial services sector. I also represented New York and represented everybody from the dairy farmers, you know, to the fishermen.
ROSE: From Wall Street to the dairy farmers.
CLINTON: Yes—everybody. And so yes, do I know people and did I help rebuild after 9/11? Yes, I did but --
ROSE: And did you take money from them, they would say.
CLINTON: Yes, but that has nothing to do with my position. Anybody who thinks that they can influence me on that ground doesn't know me very well. And these guys know me and they, you know—
ROSE: Would you say the same thing when you see these reports about the foundation and money from the foundation while you were secretary of state, people were coming in to your—
CLINTON: It's ludicrous. I mean it's ludicrous. I mean there's no there, there but the fact is I saw a lot of people when I was secretary of state and I worked really hard to increase exports from American businesses. I saw a lot of business people, I saw a lot of union leaders. I saw as many people as I could fit in the day who needed something from their government.
You know, somebody would—Fred Smith would call me up from FedEx and say the Chinese government is taking away our permits. We have been in China for decades doing Federal Express. Or Corning, a company that I knew well from my time in the senate—they're trying to put a tariff on us that is going to drive us out of business. You know, I worked really hard to get more jobs for Americans, and that meant representing big business and small business and everybody in between.
ROSE: Do we need to regulate Wall Street more than—
CLINTON: We do. That's why I have probably the toughest, most comprehensive plan and it goes way beyond Glass-Steagall. It is much broader than that. It looks at shadow banking. It looks at all of the parts of the financial markets that influenced what happened in '08 but are not big banks like AIG, like Lehman Brothers. And Paul Krugman says I have the best plan. And Sherrod Brown who is a very tough—
ROSE: Senator from Ohio.
CLINTON:?—critic of the banks thinks I have the best plan.
ROSE: Right, OK.
Why do you want to be president? I mean you have had a remarkable life.
CLINTON: Yes, I have.
ROSE: You have been in the White House. There it is over there.
CLINTON: There it is, right.
Well, I'm not doing it to move back in, although it's a wonderful place.
ROSE: So why are you doing it? I mean you know—is it about history? Is it about the first woman?
CLINTON: No, no. I mean that would all be an extra added part of it. But for me, I really love this country and I think this will be one of those watershed elections where we're either going to get the economy to work for everybody or we are going to see increasing inequality and unfairness in a way that we haven't seen since, you know, the 1920s.
We're either going to figure out how to live together despite all of our differences, show respect for people, enforce human rights, civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, workers' rights or we're going to really have the balance shift dramatically against the kind of democracy that I believe in that I think works best for America and we're either going to lead around the world or we're going to take a back seat and pay a big price for it.
So there is a lot at stake in this election and, you know, the Republicans are certainly spurring me on because of what they say and how they say it and their values which are so negative and really mean-spirited in lots of ways.
So I believe that we've got to wage and win an election about the future and the kind of country we want to have for, you know, my grandchild.
ROSE: How is she doing?
CLINTON: She's great. We had Thanksgiving with her. It was marvelous.
ROSE: Thank you for coming.
CLINTON: Thank you.
ROSE: Pleasure to see you.
CLINTON: Good to talk to you.

Let's get more on it now from Secretary Hillary Clinton, back on THIS WEEK for the first time this presidential campaign.
And a reminder for everyone watching, I worked for President Clinton, made charitable contributions in the past to the Clinton Foundation.
Welcome back.
CLINTON: Thanks, George.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Is it time to declare war on ISIS?
CLINTON: Look, we are definitely in conflict with ISIS and I think we need a new update of military authorization. The AUMF, which was passed after the attack on 9/11, should be brought up to...
STEPHANOPOULOS: Why not declare war?
CLINTON: Well, declare war is a very legal term, as you know so well. I think what we want to do is make sure we have every tool at our disposal to, number one, destroy there would-be caliphate in Syria and in Ra—in Iraq.
Number two, do everything we can to dismantle this very effective virtual jihadist network that they are using on the Internet.
And number three, do whatever is necessary to protect us here at home.
STEPHANOPOULOS: What are you concerned about in the declaration of war?
CLINTON: Well, I think that the legal experts say that if we—there are a lot who say that we already have the authority we need to go after ISIS or any international terrorist network, including al Qaeda and anybody else in the AUMF.
I think it is important, though, for the Congress to vote on behalf of the American people and to make sure that we are updating it to take into account the new authorities that that risks.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You put—you've also been reluctant to say we're fighting radical Islam. And I wonder why not.
Isn't it a mistake not to say it plain, that the violence is being pushed by radical elements in that faith?
CLINTON: Well, that's a different thing. Radical elements who use a dangerous and distorted view of Islam to promote their jihadist ambitions, I'm fine with that. I say it all the time and I go after Islamic, too.
STEPHANOPOULOS: So what's the problem with radical Islam?
CLINTON: Well, the problem is that that sounds like we are declaring war against a religion. And that, to me, is, number one, wrong but...
STEPHANOPOULOS: Even though the qualifier radical is there?
CLINTON: No, because, look, that—you know enough about religion, you've studied it. And there are radicals, people who believe all kinds of things in every religion in the world.
I don't want to do that because, number one, it doesn't do justice to the vast numbers of Muslims in our own country and around the world who are peaceful people.
Number two, it helps to create this clash of civilizations that is actually a recruiting tool for ISIS and other radical jihadists who use this as a way of saying we're in a war against the West. You must join us. If you are a Muslim, you must join us.
No. If you're a law-abiding, peace-loving Muslim, you need to be with us against those who are distorting Islam.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Can you say today that we're winning the fight against ISIS?
CLINTON: I could say today that we have a new set of threats. You know, if—if you go back and look where we were with al Qaeda in 9/11, there's no doubt bin Laden and his lieutenants were planning to carry out additional attacks, if they possibly could. And they did in places like Madrid and London, etc.
So we have dealt with that threat. It doesn't go away. We haven't eliminated it, but we've dealt with it.
Now, we have to turn our attention to the very sophisticated propagation of this new threat from ISIS.
STEPHANOPOULOS: So we're not winning that battle yet?
CLINTON: Well, we're not winning but it's too soon to say that we are doing everything we need to do. And I've outlined very clearly—
STEPHANOPOULOS:—so if you—
CLINTON:—we have to fight them in the air. We have to fight them on ground and we have to fight on the Internet. And we have to do everything we can with our friends and partners around the world to protect ourselves.
STEPHANOPOULOS: If you were in the Oval Office tonight, would you be announcing a new strategy?
CLINTON: Well, I think what—that's what we'll hear from the president, an intensification of the existing strategy and I think there's some additional steps we have to take.
If you look at the story about this woman and maybe the man, too, who got radicalized, self-radicalized, we're going to need help from Facebook and from YouTube and from Twitter. They cannot permit the recruitment and the actual direction of attacks or the celebration of violence by this sophisticated Internet user.
They're going to have to help us take down these announcements and these appeals—[crosstalk]—they get up.
STEPHANOPOULOS: How about Apple? No more encryption?
CLINTON: This is something I've said for a long time, George. I have to believe that the best minds in the private sector, in the public sector could come together to help us deal with this evolving threat. And you know, I know what the argument is from our friends in the industry. I respect that. Nobody wants to be feeling like their privacy is invaded.
But I also know what the argument is on the other side from law enforcement and security professionals. So, please, let's get together and try to figure out the best way forward.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Some of your potential rivals on the Republican side say we have to do more overseas as well. Ted Cruz says we have to carpet bomb ISIS.
CLINTON: Well, that's an easy thing to say, you know. He's never had any responsibility for trying to figure out who the bad guys are and who innocent civilians are. Clearly we have to have a much more robust air campaign against ISIS targets, against the oil infrastructure, against their leadership. I think you'll hear that from the president. And part of what I have been arguing for, for quite some time now, is that we've got to do a better job of getting back the Sunnis on the ground, along with the Kurds, who can be the fighters who will actually take back territory with air cover and with targeted attacks on ISIS infrastructure. We still are going to have to have people fighting.
Now I do not believe those should be American combat troops—[crosstalk]
STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely not; is that an absolute—
CLINTON: Where I sit right now, I think it would make things worse not better; I do believe we have to up our special ops numbers. The 50 that have been authorized need to get there. And then we need to take stock of what else we need. I think the more than 3,000 Americans that we have on the ground in Iraq, who are advising, assisting and enabling the Iraqi military have to be given the flexibility and support they need.
And I believe strongly we should perhaps ask some of our current and retired military officers, who dealt with the Sunni sheikhs in Anbar and elsewhere to once again reconstitute the fighting force that they put into the fight against Al Qaeda in Iraq.
And that was one of my biggest complaints about Maliki, because what he did was to basically not only destroy the military because of his sectarianism but also he went after those Sunni leaders in Anbar and we know from reporting that some of them are supportive of ISIS, some of the former Ba'ath military officers under Saddam Hussein.
STEPHANOPOULOS: As you know, some of your Republican rivals have also criticized you for focusing on gun control after the San Bernardino attacks. Marco Rubio points out that France has some of the strictest gun control in the world. That didn't stop the Paris attacks.
California has some of the strictest gun control laws here. It didn't stop those attacks, either.
So what law would have stopped this?
CLINTON: Well, first of all, what happened in San Bernardino was a terrorist act. Nobody is arguing with that. The law enforcement, FBI have come to that conclusion. And let's not forget, though, a week before we had an American assault on Planned Parenthood and some weeks before that we had an assault at a community college.
So I don't see these two as in anyway contradictory. We have to up our game against terrorists abroad and at home and we have to take account of the fact that our gun laws and the easy access to those guns by people who shouldn't get them, mentally ill people, fugitives, felons and the Congress continuing to refuse to prohibit people on the no-fly list from getting guns, which include a lot of domestic and international terrorists, these are two parts of the same approach that I'm taking to make us safe.
And, yes, the NRA's position always is, you know, if you can't stop everything, why try to stop anything? That's not the way law works. I mean, we have laws that are going to govern our speed limits on roads, knowing some people are going to violate it or people are going to drive drunk. But we still have laws. We need to have comprehensive background checks. We need to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole, go after what's call the Charleston loophole and end the liability for gun sellers.
STEPHANOPOULOS: On this no-fly list, the critics of that vote say that you know, you look back at this; it's indiscriminate and they go back 10 years and say 2,000 people on the watch list actually did buy guns; government hasn't found any of them committing a crime with a gun.
CLINTON: Well, again, that's like proving the negative. We have a list; if you are on that list and you believe you should not be on that list, we have a process to actually raise your objections about being on that list.
You get on the list because there is some credible evidence you belong on the list. Now obviously, that—
STEPHANOPOULOS: Some mistakes sometimes.
CLINTON:—some mistakes, of course. That's why there's a process for people to be able to raise their concerns about being on the list and then to have a process that could even lead to a legal action to remove yourself from the list.
But I, for one, am a lot—I took the shuttle from New York. I'm a lot happier having a list that keeps people off planes that there's any question about their intent or their potential behavior.
So I'm not—I can't take anybody seriously who's going to begin to chip away at the no-fly list.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Donald Trump and yesterday Jerry Falwell Jr. say the answer is for more good people to have guns. Mr. Falwell urged his students at Liberty University to actually arm themselves, get concealed carry permits.
Your response?
CLINTON: Well, he also went on—and don't forget he said this, George. He said, that way, we can take out the Muslims.
He said that, OK?
This is the kind of deplorable, not only hateful response to a legitimate security issue but it is giving aid and comfort to ISIS and other radical jihadists.
With respect to the gun issue, it' s legal to buy guns in America if you are eligible to buy a gun, you can go buy a gun and hundreds of thousands of people apparently are in the aftermath of what happened in San Bernardino.
I just want people to understand some of the threats we now face, whether it's the guy in Charleston, who should have never have been given a gun but the universal background check was not fast enough, didn't find the fact he was prohibited, went into the church and killed nine innocent people, we should be able to approach both of these with some sense of, you know, unity about how we prevent terrorist attacks and how we prevent the wrong people from getting a hold of guns.
STEPHANOPOULOS: We have to take a quick break. Stand by. Much more from Secretary Clinton later. Another live exclusive, one of the men by the taker on from a Florida governor, Jeb Bush.
[commercial break]
[begin video clip]
JEB BUSH: I think you're looking at the next Republican nominee. And here's—and here's what I promised to you, should I win this nomination I will take it to Hillary Clinton and I will whoop her.
[end video clip]
STEPHANOPOULOS: Jeb Bush there. Hillary Clinton here right now.
And as he's hoping, he's going to come up live in just a little bit hoping to take you on in the general election if you get the nomination.
I want to get into some of the issues that may come up in a general election. One of the things you're seeing Republicans really take aim at is your spending and investment programs.
CLINTON: Right.
STEPHANOPOULOS: On the show right here, proposed about $1 trillion...
CLINTON: Over 10 years.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Over 10 years in spending proposals that a lot of questions on whether you can actually pay for it by focusing tax increases only on the top 3 percent. Here's a Washington Post editorial. They say there is simply no way that the federal government can meet its current fiscal commitments plus the increased demands of an aging population and provide the new forms of middle class relief and business tax relief Mrs. Clinton promises while tapping only the top 3 percent of earners. Your response?
CLINTON: Well, I just respectfully disagree. And that's why I've laid out very specific plans about the kind of investments that I think Middle Class families particularly need that we have to have to, you know, grow our economy. And I've been very specific about how I will pay for each of those. And that is part of the, you know, underlying principle of presenting the...[crosstalk]
But I think it's a little bit amusing that the Republican National Committee would go after me, since all of their candidates and their party philosophy is massive spending cuts and massive tax decreases for those at the very top with no thought to how to pay for it or the trillions of dollars it would add to the national debt, you know.
I do come from the Clinton school of economics. And when my husband ended, we had a balanced budget and a surplus. Then President Obama inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for digging us out.
So, we're standing. And now we've got to start moving into the future again. It is going to take good fiscal responsibility, that's what I'm promising. But I'm also promising that the wealthy are going to start paying more of their fair share and help to fund some of the investments that I'm paying for.
STEPHANOPOULOS: They're also saying no tax increases at all anyone earning under $250,000. Is that a rock solid ""read my lips"" promise?
CLINTON: Well, it certainly is my goal. And I've laid it out in this campaign. And it's something that President Obama promised. It's something my husband certainly tried to achieve, because I want Americans to know that I get it, that a lot of the losses that they experienced because of the great recession are still really pulling them down.
You know, $13 trillion in family wealth was destroyed by the great recession. People lost their homes, their 401(k)s and IRAs, their college funds. So, we've got to rebuild the middle class. If we expect to have broad based prosperity, that doesn't come from...
STEPHANOPOULOS: So, it's your goal, but what if you can't get the revenue in other ways. What if the spending comes in more than it is. Will you then raise taxes?
CLINTON: You know, George, I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do. And I'm going to continue to stick with what I'm going to do. $100 billion a year in these new investments all paid for I think is a responsible approach to getting our economy creating good jobs again.
You know, I have an infrastructure plan that's on top of what the congress just passed.
So, I'm going to go out there and I'm going to defend what I'm doing. And I'm also really going to defend the Middle Class, because a lot of these proposals would have a very bad effect. Either it would raise taxes on the Middle Class or it would undermine the kind of growth and structure that we need for the Middle Class to take off again.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Another challenge you could face in this campaign, a majority of Americans question your honesty. Some GOP rivals and family members of the Benghazi victims are saying you lied to them in that hearing.
They point to emails that you sent the night of the attack, one to your daughter, Chelsea Clinton, saying—I'm going to have to put my glasses on here to actually read this. ""We were silent...two of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an al Qaeda-like group."" Another one to the Egyptian prime minister, ""we know that the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack, not a protest.""
But the family members, as you know, say you told them it was by a filmmaker, you'd go after the filmmaker. Here's what they said.
[begin video clip]
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She lied. She absolutely lied. Her daughter was able to be told differently that it was not the video, it was something else. Now if her daughter could be told, why can't I?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Either she was lying to the prime minister, or she was lying to me and to the American public. [end video clip]
STEPHANOPOULOS: Did you tell them it was not the film? And what's your response?
CLINTON: No.
You know, look I understand the continuing grief at the loss that parents experienced with the loss of these four brave Americans. And I did testify, as you know, for 11 hours. And I answered all of these questions.
Now, I can't—I can't help it the people think there has to be something else there. I said very clearly there had been a terrorist group that had taken responsibility on Facebook between the time that I—you know, when I talked to my daughter, that was the latest information. We were giving it credibility. And then we learned the next day it wasn't true. In fact, they retracted it.
This was a fast moving series of events in the fog of war. And I think most Americans understand.
STEPHANOPOULOS: How about more generally. Do you think there's something you can do to get a majority of Americans to believe you're trustworthy?
CLINTON: Well, you know, obviously I don't like hearing that, George. But I think people who have worked with me, people who voted for me twice in New York, people who I've had a very long relationship with and working on their behalf are going to know what I do and when I say I will do it I will move everything I can to get it done.
And I believe the American people who are looking for somebody who is a fighter, who will stand up there, just as I did, tell you what I will do, tell you I will do everything to make it happen. And I think my values have been consistent over the years. And the results that I've gotten are ones that I'm going to take to the American public.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Immigration going to be a big issue in this campaign?
In the past, you've said that undocumented immigrants would not be covered by your health care proposals. Here's an exchange we had in 2007.
[begin video clip]
STEPHANOPOULOS: Would illegal immigrants be covered under your plan?
CLINTON: Illegal immigrants would not be covered. No. They would not be covered. I will continue to have a safety net, which I think is in the best traditions of our country and also for public health reasons absolutely necessary.
But we did not cover them in '93, '94 and my plan does not cover them now.
[end video clip]
STEPHANOPOULOS: Now you say that undocumented immigrants should be able to buy into the exchanges. So why the shift?
CLINTON: Well, because number one the kind of plan that was passed in the Affordable Care Act gives you a market-based way of getting into the insurance market. So, if you can afford to buy a policy, you can. You don't get, however, any of the subsidies that American citizens get.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Martin O'Malley says they should. Why not?
CLINTON: Well, I disagree with him. I think part of comprehensive immigration reform should be looking at all of these issues. But as things stand right now, under the Affordable Care Act, if you have the money and you are undocumented, you can buy into it, but without the subsidies. That's why it's important we continue to support community health centers, we continue to support our hospitals because those are often the places that undocumented people and poor people go.
STEPHANOPOULOS: And what's the reason for not going further?
CLINTON: Because I don't think legally you can. I mean, that is not something that we can legally support. The law is very clear about that.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Donald Trump. Last few days he's opened up—you're laughing again.
CLINTON: I'm sorry. I can't help it.
STEPHANOPOULOS: He's opening up a new line of attack on you. Here it is.
CLINTON: Oh, dear. A new one, huh?
[begin video clip]
TRUMP: She'll do a couple of minutes in Iowa, meaning a short period of time, and then she goes home and you don't see her for five, six days, she goes home, she goes to sleep. I'm telling you. She...[laughter]...she doesn't have the strength, she doesn't have the stamina.
[end video clip]
CLINTON: Oh, goodness gracious. [laughter] You know...
STEPHANOPOULOS: I guess you don't agree.
CLINTON: Well, who can agree with anything he says that is, you know, subject to one second of fact checking?
Look, if he gets the nomination, I will be more than happy to campaign against him.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Is he the one you want to run against?
CLINTON: I don't really think about it that way. I don't have any influence over who they nominate over there and, in fact, he's not the only one saying things that are deeply distressing. A lot of the others are kind of Trump 2, you know?
Oh, whatever Trump says, maybe we won't go quite as far, but we'll get as close as we can.
So the Republicans, in their presidential nominating process, have a lot to answer for.
STEPHANOPOULOS: How do you explain why he's doing so well?
CLINTON: I don't know, because he's a—he's a reality TV star. I mean tens of millions of people have watched him for more than a decade on TV and he is part of the celebrity and he will stay whatever he wants to say and if he's held account, that—it's not true, he just brushes it off and he goes on. And I think that, you know, there's a certain attractiveness to people that here's a guy who says exactly what he believes, untrue as it may be, inflammatory as it certainly is.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, you said you're getting better at learning from your critics. They tell you things that your friends won't.
So what have you learned from your critics in this campaign?
CLINTON: You know, I've said for a long time, George, that I try—I try to take criticism seriously but not personally. And by that I mean, look, if somebody says, hey, you know, you didn't do—or she didn't do a good job answering this or, you know, I don't think that that, you know, adds up, whatever they might say, I will take that seriously.
But I really try not to take it personally and I think that's a big distinction that you have to begin to draw when you're in the public arena. You know, one of my favorite Americans, Eleanor Roosevelt, said for any woman in the public arena, you have to grow skin as thick as a rhinoceros and, you know, I try to put lotion on it, but I have...[laughter]...I've had to grow a lot of thick skin over the years.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks for joining us today.
CLINTON: Thanks, George.

24,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5000,"December 29, 2015","Remarks at a Town Hall Meeting in Portsmouth, New Hampshire",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111415,Hillary Clinton,"CLINTON: Wow. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. I am really delighted to be here on the first winter day of this season. [laughter]
To be here in this beautiful city and church that has been the site of a lot of occasions. And especially to be introduced by Brenda, who, as she said, I first met in a town hall in Dover all those months ago. 
And you know, when you call on people in town halls, as you'll see in a minute, you have no idea what they're going to say or what they are going to ask. And when I called on her, she basically said I have a husband with early onset Alzheimer's, I have a mother with Alzheimer's. I'm taking care of them. What are you going to do about Alzheimer's?
And it really caused me to think hard about the kind of president I want to be. Obviously, I want to be a president who gets the economy moving for everybody and get incomes rising and more good paying jobs. And I want to be a president that keeps us safe and secure, and takes on the threat and dangers that we face.
But I also want to be a president who works for families, like Brenda's. Who understands that the problems we keep you up at night are ones that we also have to take seriously. So, it means the world to me to have her support in this campaign.
And as I've said to her and to others who have raised issues with me during the course of my time here in New Hampshire, I will do everything I can to try and find answers. You know, in Alzheimer's, as she said, we have got five million people currently suffering. The projection is for many millions more.
It is the sixth leading cause of death in America. But unlike the other causes in the top ten, there is no real path to prevention or effective treatment, or a cure, as there is with other diseases that take so many lives.
So, my proposal is that we tackle all three of those. What can we do to try and prevent it? What can we do to try to more effectively treat it? And what would it take to invest in finding a cure? And after talking to experts, the leading experts in our country—not just in Alzheimer's, but in other neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's, the overwhelming response was, if we invested just $2 billion more a year, we would make tremendous progress.
And we would have a real shot at understanding more about this disease and trying to cure it. And the heavens support what we are going to do on behalf of Alzheimer's, and the patients, the families and the caregivers. [applause]
So, I want to thank my friend Terry Narelli , who I see here, for her great service and leadership over so many years, and for her friendship. And I want to just make a few other quick acknowledgments. And then we will move on to be ready for the questions.
The mayor. I want to thank the mayor. Where is Mayor Lister? I saw him earlier. He's here somewhere. There he is. There he is. Thank you so much, Mayor. Wonderful to see you, thank you for your support. And to the South Church, thank you for letting us be here today. [applause]
And to the overflow, which I stopped by to see on my way here. It was packed. We thank you for your patience. They have got a big screen, they are having a good time watching. And we are delighted they are here as well.
As Brenda said, on January 20, 2017, someone will raise a hand and take the oath of office, and become our 45th president. That person will, after being sworn in, and the celebrations that go with an inauguration, go into the White House, go into the oval office, and face the challenges that await.
This will be a consequential election in so many ways. Because we have work to do. I'm excited about the work. I'm confident and optimistic about the work we can do together. [applause]
But I need all of you to be part of this campaign, to be part of the first in the nation primary, because in many ways, you are the first—or depending on how you define it, the last line of defense.
The decision that New Hampshire makes is so important. And I've had a great time traveling across the state, meeting, by now, thousands and thousands of people. Having a chance to set forth my ideas and answer questions on whatever might be on someone's mind.
And I know that we are going to make the right decision—not because my name will be on the ballot, but because all of us know what the stakes are, and how high they happen to be.
So I'm excited and very much looking forward to the sprint towards the primary and to have a chance to hear even more for more folks here in the granite state about what is on your mind, about the big economic challenges, the security issues, and all those problems they keep you up at night.
I have learned a lot listening to folks here in New Hampshire. I learned a lot about the struggles, the opportunities, the disappointments. As you know, I have had two full town hall meetings just on the issue of substance abuse. When I made a list of what I was going to talk about in this campaign, it wasn't on that list.
But on my first trip here to New Hampshire in Keene, that was what was raised with me. And then on visit after visit, I was given mass cards showing the pictures of beautiful young people no longer with us because of overdoses. I met those in recovery, who thankfully, were able to get help when they needed it. I met grandmothers like myself, raising children because their children couldn't, lost to opioid addiction, heroin addiction. So that's why taking the big issue to me.
I will never stop leading with the values that I was raised with about who we are as Americans, what we're capable of doing. I will never stop listening, learning about what's on people's minds. I think you actually learn more when you listen. And I will never stop trying to work with you to solve problems.
That's the America that I was raised in, that's the America that I think we all cherish and that's the America that I'm going to do everything I can as your president to make sure it's stronger and better and fairer for everybody going forward. [applause]
So let me now turn to all of you and if you raise your hand, I think we have some microphones somewhere that we will try to get to you and give you a chance. This young—this woman right there. Yes, right there. Yes. Please stand up. Great.
QUESTION: Hi. Hi. This is such an honor. You look stunning and I've always wanted to talk with you. [applause]
I have been on your bandwagon since you were first lady. We are nine days apart, but I know why you look so much better, because you're younger. [laughter]
But it's a dream come true to have this interaction. As a cancer survivor, three years ago and going through surgery, chemo, radiation, and having a job I loved, I was let go from my job in the private sector. However, I did come to redo myself as a justice of the peace in Massachusetts and I work now with elderly through Brookline Council on aging.
And I have seen people up close and personal that are delights, as well as being able to hear them. And one of the issues I have heard lately is the hearing is a problem and that they cannot afford to buy hearing aids because they are thousands of dollars. As a senior myself now, the affordable health care for getting the supplements to Medicare is an issue as well, because if you're not—if you're too far above $100, $200 above the guidelines for Medicaid or mass health, then you cannot—you have to pay full prices to supplements, but the seniors are saying they need help in hearing.
CLINTON: Have any of you heard this before, that seniors who need help with hearing can't afford to get the hearing aids because the hearing aids are so expensive? This is something that... [applause]
I think a lot of people thought we would figure out a way to solve in the Affordable Care Act, but we haven't yet, and it's something that I take really seriously because if you can't hear well, very often, people kind of withdrawal and they become more isolated, and in fact, some of the recent research shows that, you know, that can be a trigger for other kinds of conditions and diseases.
So I don't think hearing aids when you can't hear are a luxury, I think they're a necessity. And I'm going to do everything I can... [applause]
... to move—to move them from what would be the elective list to a supported list so that people who have financial problems will be able to get help to afford them because you're 100 percent right.
It's a growing concern, in part because we have a lot more people living longer and part because we have a lot more people losing their hearing earlier. Some people say it's because of loud music that some of us remember listening to, but for whatever reason it might be, there are a lot of issues around it. So I'm going to do what I can to make sure we make hearing aids financially available on a sliding scale so more people who need them can actually get them. [applause]
Yeah, this gentleman right there. Yeah, right there in the yellow tie. Here comes the microphone.
QUESTION: Good afternoon. My name is Mr. Rogers. I happen to be in your neighborhood. [laughter]
I have a message for you; I'm from Liberia. Liberia, we elected the first female president in the continent of Africa. You already talked about... [applause]
... your hand is raised up to take that oath. I'm here on behalf of the Republic of Liberia, from Johnson-Sirleaf the president of Liberia, to say hi to you.
Since 5 o'clock this morning—I don't know where I was going—I have to find my way here. But do me one favor. I want to take a picture with you and send it to her that I was here as I promised. [laughter]
If you don't mind please. If you don't mind.
CLINTON: We will do that when we finish. Don't let me forget, and I have a feeling you won't. [laughter]
But the president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, who has been elected twice—as you rightly say, the first woman president anywhere on the continent of Africa—has been... [applause]
... has been an extraordinary leader. I mean, she inherited an economy and a government that was bankrupt. They had had this terrible long civil war that had just destroyed so much of the productive capacity in addition to taking so many lives and leaving so many maimed and injured people behind, and a lot of Liberians left Liberia because of the lack of safety.
She has been, I think, incredibly focused on trying to improve the government, improve the economy. Then she was dealt the terrible blow of Ebola and all that it meant to her country. And I want to tell you just a quick story because it's good to remember how important it is to keep trying to work with people even if you have serious disagreements with them.
I went to visit President Sirleaf when I was secretary of State and got a big briefing from all of her top officials about what was happening in her government and what they were trying to accomplish, and then I was supposed to go speak to the parliament, their Congress. And she took me aside and she said I want you to go and speak about how hard democracy is, how hard we must work together, how we have to move past the past and then said to me some of the very people who are now in the parliament were people who were very much involved in the civil war and some of the terrible things that happened there.
The leaders went to war crimes tribunal, but others for whom there wasn't evidence or they played minor roles were actually elected. Well, you can imagine. So I go to the parliament and I speak about democracy and all the rest of it and take some pictures and do some visits afterwards, and I thought boy, we think we have it hard, here she is trying to work with a Congress that includes people who were mortal enemies with one another against her, against others, and she's working so hard to make this democracy what it should be against tremendous odds.
So when we complain about our problems here in this country, we need to put them into some perspective and we need to figure out how we're going to work together even with people we disagree with... [applause]
... going into the future. So thank you. We'll take a picture, I promise. OK, we've got this young lady in the red. Yeah. And then I'll go further back to...
QUESTION: Thank you so much for being here and taking my question.
I am the mother of a 16-year-old boy who is smart and beautiful, but he also really struggles with mental illness and he's currently in an in-patient program right now. And I think my family, I think anyone would agree that my family has incredibly great health insurance. And I know that mental health parity is the law. But we still have to fight for every single admission, every single bit of treatment that we have asked for him—that the experts, his doctors who know him well all agree that this is what he needs to get better. And the health insurance company constantly tries to whittle it down and only provide the minimum amount.
And, you know, as a parent with a sick child, I only have so much energy to fight this fight and something just really needs to be done.
CLINTON: How many of you know somebody with mental health problems? [applause]
How many of you know how difficult it is to get the medical care you need to help somebody with mental health problems?
What—what you're describing is exactly the case. We passed a law—I remember voting for it back in the day—and then there was another law passed and it was incorporated in the Affordable Care Act, for what they call parity for mental health. In other words, if you have a physical illness, whatever it might be, you're supposed to get treated for it. If you have a mental health illness, you need to get treated for that, too.
Number one, we need finally to remove the stigma from mental health, because... [applause]
... too often I hear from parents who say, ""I no longer even tell people that my son has schizophrenia; my daughter is bipolar; my child has got, you know, chronic depression, because I feel like I'm judged."" No. We're learning more about how the brain operates. That's one of the things we want to do. That's part of what my goal is for Alzheimer's research. We have to understand the brain. We have to unlock its secrets. I really applaud President Obama for the investment in the brain project that his administration has made.
So we need to remove the stigma and we need to enforce the law so you get the quality and the number of treatments you need, whether it's out-patient or in-patient. And I'm going to work with the mental health community, which has laid out an agenda about how we get this right once and for all, because it's not fair. It's not fair to the person suffering and it's certainly not fair to the families who are trying to cope with that suffering and get the medical care that is needed.
So I'll do everything I can to make it somewhat easier for you and your son going forward. [applause]
Yes, this young man right here.
QUESTION: When you become president... [crosstalk]
QUESTION: When you become president, what is your plan to connect mental health problems and guns to make sure that me, my brothers and my friends are safe from violence at school?
CLINTON: Oh, wow. [applause]
I'm going to do everything I can do. And I'm never going to stop trying. Because right now, we lose 90 people a day to gun violence—homicides, suicides and tragic avoidable accidents. That's 33,000 people a year. I think we need to pass the laws that I have been advocating for. We need comprehensive background checks. We need to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole. [applause]
And we need to make sure that the information that is needed to make the judgment about whether someone is qualified to buy a gun is in the record. And very often, we don't have real-time information because we also have to close what's called the Charleston loophole, where the killer in Charleston went to buy a gun. He filled out the form. Under the loophole, he could come back and get it after three business days. The information that he wasn't eligible because he had a felony conviction didn't come through until after he went—used that gun and murdered nine people in a church like this in Charleston.
So we have work to do. And the mental health piece of this is especially troubling, because you don't want to unfairly stigmatize people, but you want to protect the community, so you've got to have information. The killer at Virginia Tech, you might remember, had been committed. But that information was not in the records.
We need to prohibit people who are drastic abusers with restraining orders against them from getting guns. And we certainly should get the Congress to prohibit anyone who is on the no-fly list, the would-be terrorists, from buying guns in America. And... [applause]
CLINTON: ... and we need to repeal the immunity from liability that was given to gun makers and sellers by the Congress... [applause]
... so that we can do as good a job as possible trying to prevent people who shouldn't have guns in the first place from getting them. And I know we can do this in a constitutionally consistent way.
So I'm going to reach out. I'll work with anybody, but I will also continue to advocate for this, because we are in a whole different era, where these mass shootings, these 33,000 people killed every year, has become a rebuke to us, that we can't figure—figure out how to deal with this. And I, personally, am asking gun owners to support these changes. Because right now, what I just outlined—comprehensive background checks and the like—is supported by 92 percent of Americans and 85 percent of gun owners. But the gun lobby lives off of fear and misinformation and is willing to say and do whatever it takes... [applause]
CLINTON: And it is really time for gun owners to form a different organization that will do more on gun safety, do more on gun responsibility, and stand up for the safety of our children and our communities. [applause]
CLINTON: OK. This gentleman with the cap on has been standing up. So why—why don't you ask the next question, sir?
QUESTION: Thank you so much, Hillary. First and foremost, I want to say that I love you. [laughter]
And I really mean it.
And so—my name is James Mackey , I'm a community organizer for a non-profit organization called Teen Empowerment. And what we do is we hire young people to talk about issues, and we create initiatives around those issues to build relationships with young people in the community.
And so, I work in Boston, Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan, all the—all the... [applause]
... thank you. All the communities that are underserved. And so my question to you is, is that—so we just lost one of our youth organizers, two days ago, from a tragic accident. And there are 5.6 million young people around our nation who are 16 to 24, who are disconnected from school as well as from work.
And when they are not in school or at work, what are they doing? And—and plus, they're in underserved communities. And so my question to you is, what is your stance on supporting young people who really need opportunity, and more resources out there for better education, as well as better employment? And what will you do as president to help support those 5.6 million young people around the nation who it is affecting? Yeah. [applause]
CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you. And first of all, thank you for being an organizer and reaching out to young people. That is so important. And... [applause]
... I hope you heard what he said, because think about this number: 5.6 million young people between 16 and 24, who are neither in school nor at work. That is a recipe for unemployment, for incarceration, for all kinds of behavior that has bad consequences for themselves and for their families.
And it's something I care deeply about, because if you look at where we are, underserved communities have had a resurgence of poverty. Inner-cities, old suburbs, small towns and rural areas, Native American reservations, coal country, this is across America where we have disconnected young people from a path to a productive life.
And I think we've got to figure out how we rebuild that. So I am absolutely committed and I am going to say quickly three things. I want to support programs like what you described you do, because we've got to get people in the communities—it's literally a one on one project in many cases.
What is it that can be done for John or Mary or whomever? So we need to support nonprofit groups, advocacy groups, organizing groups, faith communities to do this work. But secondly, we have to take a hard look. And one of the ideas that I have been thinking about is we take a hard look at communities where you have very persistent poverty, poor education outcomes, other kinds of indicators of problems.
And we really have to figure out what works. People have tried a whole bunch of different things, and a lot of it doesn't work. Throwing money at it doesn't necessarily work. Building relationships is the work that has to be done. How do we do that?
I don't think the answer lies in Washington, although as president, I can be a convener, a coordinator, a catalyst. I think we have to do this in communities. And I want to provide support and resources, where possible, to give more people a chance to do that relationship building.
We are going to need more GED programs very we need more community college programs. We are going to need more apprenticeship programs. We're going to need more pathways out. And we are going to have to also take a hard look at the living conditions and the schooling conditions that a lot of these kids face.
I used to have what I would call the Chelsea test, when I would go into the school. And as the first lady in Arkansas, the first lady in the United States or the Senator in New York, I would walk into a school and I would spend some time, I would look around. I would look at the physical facilities, I'd talk to the staff area and I would say, would I want my daughter to go to the school?
A lot of times the answer was yes, absolutely. A lot of time the answer was no. Some of the conditions, the physical conditions in these schools was deplorable. And then you have to look at the housing that a lot of people are living in. A lot of this housing is really substandard but in dangerous ways. and I will just end with this.
Lead paint poisoning effects many, many children in the northeast, the mid-atlantic, and the midwest, where we had a lot of old housing. Where we have old pipes on water supplies. Lead poisoning is an academic and behavioral deficits inducement. People end up being worse off. And we are not doing enough to notice it, to deal with it, to eradicate it.
So there's a lot I think we have to take a hard look at. And I will do that. But it will be in partnership with young people like you and the groups you recognize and represent. Thank you. [applause]
CLINTON: I see a hand way back there. Yes, yes. Black and white, yes. Right there. Yes.
QUESTION: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. It is an honor. I'm from Alabama and I know it is important for candidates to focus on undecided voters in swing states. But for liberals and conservatives states, we sometimes feel left out of the fray.
And I would hope that the Democratic Party and your campaign will go into those conservative states and really push and give us hope and encouragement that your platforms will be heard there. And I ask you, please don't leave us to the Republicans. [laughter] [applause]
CLINTON: Well, I have been down to Alabama twice already in this campaign. And I will do my best to help rebuild the Democratic Party in places where it hasn't been particularly successful in recent years. Because I think there is a lot we can recommend. I really do.
I think that our view about what we need to do to get the economy going again, and fix all the problems that we see with the Affordable Care Act, and get early childhood education—you know, there is a very inconvenient fact that my Republican friends hate when I mention. But it is true. Our economy does better when we have a Democrat in the White House. [applause]
And that is true in Alabama, just like it's true anywhere. And we are going to make that case, do the very best we can to kind of get people to recognize that we are all in this together. And getting the economy to work better, getting our government to be more effective and productive in producing results, building on the progress that President Obama made it—remember, he inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Recession.
And then he had to make sure it didn't fall into a Great Depression. I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for making sure that did not happen. [applause]
So, we are going to make that case. We are going to make that case throughout the country. I hope, effectively. At least, I'm counting on that. Yes, the man in the blue vest. Yeah, yeah.
QUESTION: This is an honor. I'm a retired teacher from Massachusetts. I've never been involved in any political aspects. I've—we are about the same age, actually, Hillary. So, it's only—I respect one woman in my life, which is my wife.
You are the No. 2 woman I respect more than any woman on this planet. I have watched you since your—you know, your early political days. We are both grandparents of very young grandchildren. I'm a little bit nervous here.
But I just wanted to tell you that there is one thing that has—in the minds of most people—we have doubt. We have doubt about so many things that we've hoped for, and we've seen evolve.
You eliminate doubt for someone like me. You eliminate doubt. I have—your knowledge and your grasp of what's happening, and what you've been through, and what you see—and things that you know that we don't know are what make me feel confident that you were going to be the next president. [applause]
Thank you. Thank you. There is a little hand right there, that little girl right there. I like having all of these young people here.
QUESTION: Hi. Hi, I'm Ella. I think that there is a lot of people who don't have enough money for college, and schools and that kind of stuff. So, how can we help that?
CLINTON: It's a very good question, Ella. [applause]
That is a great question. How many people have student debt, or ever had student debt? Guess that's nearly everybody here, practically. Look, I think there are two things, two big things we have to do. First, I want to make college debt-free, so that you don't have to borrow money for tuition to go to a four-year public college or university. [applause]
And it will work, because what we are going to do is to focus on it being a compact between the federal government and state governments, and institutions. Because I do think that colleges and universities have to take a really hard look at what they are spending money on. [applause] So, that they make sure what they are spending on is related to helping prepare a student for life, for profession or career. I think states have dis-invested in higher education. A lot of the money that states use to put into colleges and universities has gone into everything from prisons to roads, you name it.
So, we got to figure out how the state does more of its fair share. I think that in order for it to be debt free, families above a certain income level will have to continue to fund college. I think that's only fair. And I want students to work 10 hours a week. Because I want students to know they are working for their education. And that it's something they really value. [applause]
And I want to do more on national service so more students get big discounts because they will have done national service. Military service, civilian service. [applause]
And we've got a good G.I. bill now coming after 9/11—a new G.I. bill for the new generation of vets, but I want to make sure they don't get ripped off because sometimes that veteran education money is going to institutions that don't really serve them well. So we have some work to do to make sure that it is done right.
And then I want to help you pay down your debt by refinancing your debt. Just like you can refinance a mortgage or a car payment, you ought to be able to refinance your college debt. [applause]
And it really is quite disturbing to me that we have had, as everybody knows in the last several years, because of the great recession, mostly—we've had really low interest rates. And yet, when I ask students what interest rate they are paying on their debt, lots of them are paying six, seven, eight, nine, 10 percent. Some of it private, some of it to the government. And I do not believe the federal government should be making a profit off of lending money to students to be able to go get a college education. [applause]
So we're going to—we're going to make a lot of changes, Ella. So certainly by the time you get there, but hopefully sooner, we will have a lot of good changes that you'll be able to take advantage of.
Yes. There's a lady right here and maybe—let's see. Here comes the microphone. Right there.
QUESTION: Thank you for coming to Portsmouth. I was very disappointed in the last debate that the international agreement on climate that was agreed upon in Paris was not even mentioned. So could you comment on that and tell us as president, what you would do?
CLINTON: Yes. I happen to think the... [applause]
The Paris agreement was a historic achievement and I give a lot of credit to President Obama's leadership because if the United States had not led, it would not have happened, and I know how hard it was, because President Obama and I went to the big international climate meeting in Copenhagen in 2009. And literally, we could not even get a meeting with the Chinese, the Indians, the South Africans and the Brazilians.
Led by the Chinese, who did not want to have a meeting with us where they might make a commitment to actually doing anything. And so we had to chase them around this big convention center in Copenhagen, and we finally found them. Chinese guards were preventing the entry in and the president is a lot taller than I am, and so he just kind of pushed through in the hands went up so I ducked under and we got in the room. [laughter]
And then, you know, the president says, ""We've been looking all over for you."" We pulled up chairs and we sat down and we said, ""You know, look, we have to begin this process."" And their argument was the typical argument. ""We didn't cause the problem. It was the developed countries."" We said, ""Look, that's fine, but you are now the biggest emitters and you are going to have to help solve the problems,"" and they began to agree to do some internal accounting and public reporting.
Fast forward from '09, we had a series of climate meetings in Cancun and Durban, and we made progress. So the agreement coming out of Paris does, for the first time, include every nation, regardless of level of development or need or threat from climate change.
And now, we have to enforce it. So as president, I would do everything I can, using every tool that I had to hold other nations accountable, including our own, about what we need to do both to try desperately to move more quickly away from fossil fuels towards clean, renewable energy, to try to at least put a cap on temperature rise and emissions and try the best we can at the same time to do more on resilience and adaptation to try and help countries and parts of countries that are particularly at risk.
Portsmouth is the seacoast city. You all—I know the mayor and everybody, you're working hard on resilience and you're really taking a hard look, but you need a partner in Washington and in the Congress, as well as the president. There are a lot of places in our country—Alaska has already been hit hard. They've had to relocate some villages from the coastline. I know that Miami is really facing some big challenges.
So we've got to get serious about this because it's happening. We are seeing the results of this drastic increase in temperature that human activity has not just contributed to, but caused. So, it's time for us to... [applause]
... deal with the problem, but I believe it's also a great opportunity. And this is what I have a hard time understanding from my Republican counterparts. You know, they all are into denial and when asked about climate change typically will say well I don't know, I'm not a scientist. You know, the answer to that is go talk to one... [laughter]
... and listen to what the scientists tell you, and... [applause]
... so from my perspective, we have economic opportunities here that we're leaving on the table. We can do so much more, putting people to work in wind, in solar, in advanced biofuels. We can make a difference in the economy with new, good-paying jobs. And I will say this. You know, when I'm not in New Hampshire, I'm often in Iowa. Iowa now produces one-third of its electricity from renewables, predominantly wind.
Seven thousand people now work in the wind industry. They are now assembling turbines in old, abandoned factories, they are educating young people in the community colleges to actually work on these turbines. So they have gone the whole supply chain, and good for them. Every state should be doing the same. Every state has that same economic potential here... [applause]
... and when we—when we let politics, really politics that are under the thumb of the fossil fuel industry—and in particular, the Koch Brothers—decide the future of our country, shame on us. We're better than that, we're smarter than that, and we all—Republican, Democrat, Independent, whatever—we all need to say we are taking on this challenge and we're going to make jobs and incomes rise because of it. That to me is the right approach for us to be taking. [applause]
Oh my goodness. So many hands, so little time. Well, you're standing right there. Why don't we go with that lady right there. Yeah.
QUESTION: Hi, thank you. I've spent a lot of time teaching art in women's prisons, and the majority of the women I've worked with are from minority, low-income families and the majority of them are in their second, third, fourth visits to prison, and they say it's easier to just live in that cycle than try to break out of it. How would you approach helping end that cycle? [applause]
CLINTON: First of all, thank you for working in our prisons. You know, we are still in the midst of the holiday season, and for those of us who celebrate Christmas, it's good to remember that we are called upon to care for the homeless and the stranger and the prisoner, the refugee.
Those are important reminders at a time when there's so much political dispute about all of this, and I think we have incarcerated too many people. We have 5 percent of the world's population... [applause]
... but 25 percent of the prison population, and we actually have one-third of women who are imprisoned anywhere in the world imprisoned in the Untied States. So we have to begin in a thoughtful way to deal with the effects of incarceration.
Obviously, from my perspective, we need to take a hard look at the low-level, non-violent offenses for which people end up incarcerated. We have to take a hard look at our bail system because we have too many people in jail and prison who haven't even been tried yet. We don't know if they're guilty of anything other than poverty because they can't meet the bail that has been set for them. And we need to do a careful analysis of who can and should be released from prison while we try to deal with people who don't pose a threat to the community, particularly the numbers of people with low-level drug offenses who need treatment, not imprisonment. And so we've got to look at all of this and... [applause]
... yet, I don't think that's enough, and it goes back to the gentleman's question over there in the hat. The issue is, OK, if we're going to divert people from prison, what are the things we're going to do?
Well, I'm a big believer in drug courts, I think drug courts are a much better option than imprisoning people. They should be given recovery, they should be held accountable. I believe that there are more programs that are cheaper and better.
And I want to just quickly tell you about a program I visited in Reno, Nevada. And it was a program originally started for alcoholics—people that were found on the street and were picked up, taken to jail. A month later, they'd be on the street again, taken to jail, or maybe they'd end up being put into an ambulance, taken to the emergency room, maybe admitted. A month or two later, back on the street.
So, a really great partnership between the county sheriff's office and Catholic charities said, ""there's gotta be a better way. First of all, it's really expensive to jail and imprison people."" So they built a facility that had small bedrooms, that had work to be done, that offered this option to people they were picking up, saying, ""you can either go back to jail, back to—you know, the life you've had, or you can try this.""
And they got enough people to try it. They tested them three times a day to make sure they weren't cheating. And the sheriff said to me—he said, ""you know—want to know the best thing about this?"" He said, ""because I can—I can justify this anywhere.""
He said the first year, the sheriff's office and the hospital and the jail saved $4 million, because they were no longer putting people in high, intensive places like jails and emergency rooms.
Now they're moving on to drug addiction, because we've got to think differently about how to help people overcome the problems that they confront. And I just don't think jail is a place for people with substance abuse or mental health problems. And therefore, we need different approaches... [applause]
... that will be actually better and cheaper. So let's—let's try to figure out how we're gonna do that, too.
This young man.
QUESTION: Hi. I have a dad that works for people with developmental disabilities. And I have an uncle with autism. And I was wondering, what are some of the ways that you can help people with disabilities and people with special needs that need help?
CLINTON: Great question. You know, thanks. [applause]
Thank you dad for us, too, OK? Is your dad here? Thanks, Dad.
Yeah. People with disabilities—you know, I was very proud that the United States became the first nation in the world to open schools to people with disabilities. And it was the—I worked on that, when I was with the Children's Defense Fund. And we went door to door, asking people, ""do you have a school-age child who's not in school?""
And we found a blind kids and kids in wheelchairs and kids with behavioral problems, and then gave all that data to the Congress, and the Congress acted, and schools were opened. And then the—the Americans With Disabilities Act was passed, another great accomplishment. A bipartisan accomplishment that really made a huge difference. [applause]
So now we have to do more to make sure that we provide supportive housing, that we support families. The biggest concern people talk to me about when they have children with disabilities, and particularly with autism, is what happens when they are no longer there to take care of their children, and how will that work out.
I'm actually rolling out a plan about autism in about a week, where I talk about all the different things... [applause]
... that we need to do to try to support families and people who are diagnosed as on the autism-spectrum disorders.
How many of you know somebody with autism? Wow. Wow. Well, you know, the latest data from the Centers on Disease Control is that -you know, 1 out of 68 children have some feature that would place them on the autism spectrum.
So that's something we need to deal with. So we're—we'll be addressing that. But I guess my bottom line would be we—we, as communities, need to support families and need to support people with disabilities so that they can go as far as their talent, their hard work, their skills will take them.
And I think there are a lot of opportunities that we're just learning about that we can apply, and that I will talk about when I roll this out.
I've just been told this is my last question. And so—oh, my goodness. This is totally—I should not have said that. This is totally, totally unfair. Oh my gosh. I—I ...
QUESTION: Here! Here! [laughter]
CLINTON: You—OK. So you've got promoters right here. This young man, right there? OK. You got a whole team here that is—is giving you a chance. Go ahead. Because I really do love to call on kids, because that's what this election is actually all about, is their future. [applause]
QUESTION: My name is Relic Riley. I'm from Massachusetts, and my mother over there is complaining that she does not get much more money than my father. My mother is an... [laughter] [applause]
My mother is an engineer. I meant teacher. My father's the engineer. And I—I think that my mother is working more harder than my... [laughter] [applause]
I don't know my grammar. I just don't know my grammar.
I think my mother isn't working much harder—is working more harder than my father, and she deserves to have more money. [laughter]
Like, get more money than my father. [laughter]
Because she's taking care of children, and—I just don't think it's fair.
CLINTON: That is really so sweet. [applause]
CLINTON: I—you have a great future as an advocate, and—look, I—I do think equal pay for equal work is still a problem. And I think the Paycheck Fairness Act, which I supported every year it came up when I was in the Senate, is really important to try to open up the—the pay arena to more transparency.
Because right now, if you are doing a job, and you ask how much somebody else makes, you can be fired or retaliated against. And how are we ever gonna know that we get fair pay for—you know, not just women, although that's the biggest discrepancy, but particularly people who are in—you know, positions where it's hard to ask for more, because of their—you know, their working conditions.
I had a young man here in New Hampshire tell me the reason he was supporting me is because I was in favor of equal pay. And when I asked him why, he said because he got his first grown-up adult job when he was 17, and he went to work in the same store where his mother had worked—that's how he got the job—and, his first pay period, brought his paycheck home, he showed his mother, and he watched her face fall.
And he asked her why, and she said, ""you're making more now than I am making after four years on the same job."" And I said to him—I said, so what was the reason? I mean, how—how did this add up?
He said, ""you know, I tried to find out,"" and he said, ""basically the manager said, 'well, we like to identify young men who can go far in the company, and so we want to give you the incentive to stay and maybe get into one of our training programs.'""
And I really—this young man was very touching. He said, ""but they never asked my mom, and she's much more organized than I am."" [laughter]
So I think that we still have problems, and if you deny those problems, you are denying the fastest way to increase incomes in America. And that is to make sure women are paid what they deserve in the job that they do. [applause]
Thank you all, very much. Thank you. [applause]

This is a big interview for us. Twenty-two years we've been doing this, and this is one of our big ones. I want to tell you—want to ask you about 12 questions tonight...
CLINTON: OK.
MATTHEWS: ... in two segments. I hope we get through them all.
CLINTON: Thanks, Chris.
MATTHEWS: Back in 2001, when we had 9/11 and you were a senator from New York, there was a different spirit in this country, including the Republican Party. You had a Republican president who went on the air and made it clear time and again this is not a battle between the West and the East. It's not about Muslims. It's about terrorism. And he did it so effectively.
And now we have the leading candidate for the Republican nomination for president basically declaring a war on Muslims, saying they're not allowed in the country, the whole works. What do you make of this?
CLINTON: Well, it's deeply distressing to me because I, as you know, well remember what happened after 9/11. And I have publicly given President Bush a lot of credit for the way that he set the tone and his entire administration echoed that.
And now we need to have a sense of unity and purpose in combatting terrorism. I view it as a threat. I believe ISIS cannot be contained. It has to be defeated. But in order to do that, we need to work within our own country with Muslim Americans, so that what I'm hearing from the other side, is not only offensive and shameful, it's dangerous, counterproductive. And of course, we have to work with countries around the world in order to have a unified coalition against terrorism.
And I've laid out very clearly what I think needs to be done, and it does include an American-led air alliance, and we're doing that. And we're supporting troops on the ground that are not Americans, special forces, but we do need to have the Kurds and the Arabs with special forces support, but not American combat troops.
And we need to go after the arc of instability that fuels this terrorist ideology from North Africa to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and go after their funding and their foreign fighters and their very effective use of the Internet.
But then the third pillar of my approach is we have to be safe here at home. We have to work with our friends and allies around the world. And I know you just got back from Israel. We have a lot of important work to do with countries from one end of the globe to the other. And we need to do it in alliance with Muslims here in America and elsewhere. And that's what I'm advocating.
MATTHEWS: That's why I'm concerned about the Republican Party because this ethnic way of going at this situation, the way they seem to be going at the Muslim people, rather than the terrorists—this started—remember when the man whose name we dare not speak anymore, Donald Trump—I mean, the fact is, Trump started his sort of initiation in politics by saying the president of the United States was an illegal immigrant, he was probably a Muslim, he had a—he almost was an identity thief who created a notion of himself through a phony birth certificate, a phony birth announcement, and he was somehow—in fact, he used to say things—Trump would say things like, Nobody knew him in school, like he's some phantom impersonator, usurper.
The Republican Party, every time he did that, said nothing.
CLINTON: Right.
MATTHEWS: Boehner, the speaker of the House, who was pretty much respected, wouldn't—isn't this a Republican Party problem, that started with Trump's first arrival on the world stage as some sort of politician, that it's ethnic with them? The president of the United States is one of the bad guys, one of the—if not the terrorists, one of the sneaker-in-ers who snuck into the country and assumed an identity. It's pretty sick.
CLINTON: Well, it's very divisive and I think counterproductive. It undermines our values, who we are as a people. We are a nation of immigrants, which you know so well. And when I hear what's coming from the other side—and it's not just one person. There's an echo chamber there. And it's very troubling to me to try to divide and conquer, divide and conquer, and you know, a house divided against itself cannot stand.
We need to be united. And we should not reward people who use inflammatory rhetoric, who use the kind of derogatory comments, whether it's about Muslims or Mexicans or women or people with disabilities, whoever it might be. That is not a sign of leadership. That's a sign of, you know, showmanship, of desperation that should be rejected roundly by the American people.
MATTHEWS: By the way, you know, my grandmother spoke Irish when I grew up. I had an Irish accent in the house.
CLINTON: Yes?
MATTHEWS: Let me ask you about guns...
CLINTON: I would have guessed that.
MATTHEWS: Yes. Well, let's talk about guns because you've shown a lot of guts out there. And we know all the politics of guns. You know it. You ran with your husband. You ran before for president.
There are states that have a real gun culture, including the state I grew up in, Pennsylvania. And you come from that part of the world, in a way. And you do come from [inaudible] Scranton...
CLINTON: My father comes from, right.
MATTHEWS: So you know there's a gun culture. How do you deal with that in Electoral College situations, where you've got to beat a Republican come next November, hopefully, for you? How do you—how do you make sure that the gun people don't emotionally say, Oh, she's an enemy of guns?
CLINTON: Well, I think it's important to be focused on what we can do together, and that's why I do support comprehensive background checks and to close the gun show loophole and the on-line loophole and what's called the Charleston loophole...
MATTHEWS: Right.
CLINTON: ... and to prevent people who are on the no-fly list from getting guns. And in fact, what I am proposing is supported by a great majority of the American people and a significant majority of gun owners.
Just today at Osage—you were here when I was speaking to the crowd—and then afterwards, I always take time so people can come up to me. Sometimes I do it publicly, a lot of times I do it privately, what's on their minds.
And a man came up. He had a veterans cap on. And he said, you know, I'm a gun owner, he said, but I don't see any reason why we can't do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: And he asked me, What can I do? I said, Well, please stand up against the NRA and the gun lobby. And please talk to your friends because what we are proposing is consistent with constitutional rights.
But I agree with you, Chris, it's going to be part of the—you know, the political debate, and frankly, the battle in a lot of parts of our country going forward.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: But it is so important, when we lose 90 people a day, 33,000 Americans every year, and when you have met as many victims of gun violence as I have, when you've sat there and you've listened to their stories about losing a child, losing a husband, losing a parent—and I've met with the mothers who have lost children to gun violence by police hands, by, you know, more likely, gun and gang—deadly combination. I've just so many people, from Columbine to Sandy Hook.
I just can't remain silent. And I think we are at a turning point. And what I said to the man here is, you know, There needs to be a rival organization to the NRA of responsible gun owners, who know that their hunting rights...
MATTHEWS: Moms Demand Action.
CLINTON: ... their collecting rights, all of that is not going to be affected. So I'm going to keep beating the drum, and I'm delighted that the president announced the actions he did today.
MATTHEWS: Well, you're back in this fight.
CLINTON: I am.
MATTHEWS: You know, you were here eight years ago. Here you are again.
CLINTON: I am. I am.
MATTHEWS: And I do wonder sometimes at you sometimes, your ability—your... [laughter]
To use the word ""stamina,"" that hasn't been used correctly lately. You know, I'm a student of history, like you are, and I remember Nixon back in 1950 ran against Helen Gehagen Douglas. And she was one of the first women, liberal, to go out there...
CLINTON: She is.
MATTHEWS: ... progressives, to try to win a big seat.
Right.
And he used to—he said things like, You know, it's awfully hard on a woman. [laughter] He used these little shots at her.
CLINTON: Yes.
MATTHEWS: Here we are, two thirds of a century later...
CLINTON: Right.
MATTHEWS: ... and the leading Republican candidate is out saying that you don't have the stamina, the strength—is this sexism? Is it what it is?
CLINTON: Well, you know, I have a new year's resolution...
MATTHEWS: I know. I've heard this... [crosstalk]
CLINTON: I will not respond to his, you know...
MATTHEWS: What does it say about the Republican...
CLINTON: ... personal attacks.
MATTHEWS: Well, let me try to phrase it—I feel like a lawyer now. How do I rephrase? [laughter]
How does the Republican Party deal with the fact they're voting for this guy, that 35 percent of people are supporting him, and even though he's making these charges, which a lot of people would say are—why would he go after your stamina, rather than Bill's stamina or George McGovern's stamina or anybody else's, except you're a woman?
CLINTON: Well, look...
MATTHEWS: He's older than you.
CLINTON: That's true.
MATTHEWS: I'm older than you.
CLINTON: That's true!
MATTHEWS: My stamina's all right.
CLINTON: That's true.
MATTHEWS: So why is he doing this?
CLINTON: Well, why does he do whatever he does? I can only tell you what I hear from people, and what I hear from people is really about their lives and their future. I mean, lot of this back and forth that goes on...
MATTHEWS: I know, but...
CLINTON: ... in the political...
MATTHEWS: ... he's winning.
CLINTON: ... universe—well, we'll see. We'll see. We haven't had a single caucus. We haven't had a single primary. The Republicans will have to choose whoever they decide to be their nominee, and I'm looking forward, if I am so fortunate to be the nominee, to run against whoever they put up.
I'm just going to keep working really hard, like right out there today, you know, getting people to caucus for me, connecting them up with my great organizers. I have an amazing team here...
MATTHEWS: OK...
CLINTON: ... and we're just going to work as hard as we can to make my case.
MATTHEWS: He ain't going to stop. He did an interview with my colleague, Joe Scarborough, this morning. It's going to air tomorrow morning. He's out there again saying he's going after your family. He said it's fair to go after them.
CLINTON: Well, I just...
MATTHEWS: He's just going to keep doing it.
CLINTON: Well...
MATTHEWS: He says you're an enabler. He's making it personal with you.
CLINTON: Well, he can say whatever he wants to say. I'm going to keep talking about what people talk to me about...
MATTHEWS: OK.
CLINTON: ... and what they talk to me about is, What will you do about prescription drug prices?
MATTHEWS: By the way, you're good on that one. That's so true.
CLINTON: Well, it's unbelievable what's happening to people!
MATTHEWS: Everybody's taking drugs now, and you need—if you have diabetes, like me, or somebody, everybody needs it—if your parents died of Alzheimer's—you talked about that out here.
CLINTON: Yes.
MATTHEWS: These are real things.
CLINTON: These are real things that people talk to me about.
MATTHEWS: OK...
CLINTON: And I'm going to be a president who does the big stuff that gets in the headlines, that, you know, you and other analysts and reporters talk about, and I'm going to do the stuff that keeps people awake at night...
MATTHEWS: OK...
CLINTON: ... like, you know, making sure they can afford their prescription drugs.
MATTHEWS: I want to say something nice about you.
CLINTON: Oh, please! [laughter]
MATTHEWS: No, I have to. I'm personally responsible. Back when you had all the difficulty in the second administration of President Clinton, your husband, and you had a difficult situation you had to go through—and you went through it, and I think you were completely stunned by it initially, and then you had to deal with it as you became aware of what was going on.
And what did you do? You didn't cry. You didn't go away and say, Gee, whiz, this is terrible, why am I going through this? What you did is you went out and you acted like a champion for Democrats. You went around the country campaigning like mad. You were the real banner carrier for the Democratic Party in '98.
And something interesting happened. An epiphany happened. Somehow, out there campaigning in New York for Chuck Schumer and other people, you said something to yourself. You said, You know what? Something good can come out of this for me. I can become a hero to people.
And you ran for the Senate from New York, when a lot of people were critics of you, would have loved you to have fallen on your face. They would have eaten it up if you'd gone down in a ditch up in New York and lost—because at the time, you were running against Rudy...
CLINTON: That's right.
MATTHEWS: ... who looked unbeatable.
CLINTON: That's right.
MATTHEWS: And you had the guts to go out there. What made you do it? Because there's a lot of women watching right now. Half my viewers are women. And they want to hear what's it take for a woman to just rise out of a situation which is pretty bad and come out of it and say, You know what? I can rise to this occasion. How did you do it?
CLINTON: Well, you know, that's a great question because I...
MATTHEWS: Do you know the answer?
CLINTON: I didn't have any sense that all of this would happen. I really didn't.
MATTHEWS: Well, New York came and fell in love with you and said, We like you.
CLINTON: And—and...
MATTHEWS: Come up here, live up here, be our senator.
CLINTON: They did, and Please run. And I said, no, no, no. I said no, no...
MATTHEWS: Charlie Rangel...[crosstalk]
CLINTON: Yes, and so many others. And I absolutely said no. And I'll tell you what changed my mind, and it was maybe something that other women can relate to because I was in the news, like, Would she or wouldn't she, and I kept saying, I'm not going to. And I was first lady going up to do an event in New York City to promote women in athletics, and Billie Jean King and great athletes were there.
MATTHEWS: She's great.
CLINTON: And so I was introduced by this young woman. I think she was, like, the volleyball or basketball captain. And I came up and shook her hand, and you know, I said, Great job. She leaned over to me and she said, Dare to compete, Mrs. Clinton, dare to compete.
And I thought, Wow. You know, I have encouraged so many women and girls to compete on the athletic fields, in academics...
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: ... in politics, in business, and I'm being asked to compete. And it...
MATTHEWS: And stick your neck out.
CLINTON: And stick my neck out. And it is scary! It is.
MATTHEWS: It's different than supporting your spouse, isn't it.
CLINTON: Totally different. ?I mean, I had the hardest time when I started saying, I am me. I'm happy to say, you know, my husband this, or candidate X or Y, but to stand up there and be the person out there...
MATTHEWS: Wow.
CLINTON: And it is a big challenge. And I think because, you know, we're coming into our own as women in all walks of life, but still, there's something a little bit daunting about...
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: ... holding yourself out, asking people to support you, to give you money, to vote for you. It's hard.
MATTHEWS: And you know who went through that? Another New York senator, Bobby Kennedy.
CLINTON: Yes.
[crosstalk]
MATTHEWS: ... his brother's brother.
CLINTON: I remember reading about that.
MATTHEWS: And then all of a sudden, he had to be the guy and stuck his neck out.
Anyway, we're going to come back and talk about...
CLINTON: OK.
MATTHEWS: ... you because I—the way I look at politics—and you called me an analyst. I like that. I'm an analyst. And I look at this race for president, 2016, which we're now in, and really, that list is closing. And a guy at Georgetown, a professor, once said, there's a difference between free will and free choice. Free choice means there's a limit number of choices. And it looks like there's a limited number of choices for the president of the United States coming in 2016, and you're one of them.
We'll be right back and talk about Hillary Clinton as the possibly the next—in fact, the first-ever woman commander-in-chief of the United States.
[commercial break]
MATTHEWS: Madam Secretary, you may have a new title if this campaign is successful. You have to win the primary. You got to beat Bernie. You got to beat Martin O'Malley. But if all that happens, then you have to beat whoever on the Republican side, you could be the first woman commander-in-chief.
And this is all happening, perhaps coincidentally, or maybe culturally, when Ashton Carter, the secretary of defense, has just made it clear now that all combat roles are open to women. This is something unique in our history. Now, maybe every woman doesn't want these jobs.
CLINTON: Right.
MATTHEWS: But these jobs are now open. You can go out there and be infantry. You can go out there, you know, with a knife in your teeth and you can go swinging on ropes into whatever valley you got to go kill people in. Women are going to be doing that, just like in Israel, where I just was.
How's our country going to adapt to that? And is it important culturally for us to have women in this combat role?
CLINTON: I think it's important to open up all roles to women, but I also agree with Secretary Carter that you have to have standards. And women and men have to meet those standards because we're talking literally life or death. So I am...
MATTHEWS: You mean like climbing ropes and things like that.
CLINTON: Absolutely. Absolutely. And how much weight you can carry because maybe one of your, you know, fellow soldiers will need that one day. And so I am a huge supporter of women being able to break whatever glass ceilings are holding them back...
MATTHEWS: If they can physically handle it.
CLINTON: They've got to be able—and mentally.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: You know, it—physically, mentally, you have to be prepared. You have to be ready. And I think that you're right, not every woman's going to want to do that, and some of the women who want to do it are not going to qualify.
But we just had a few women pass Ranger school, which is an enormously...
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: ... competitive, grueling experience. It was just less than a handful, but they proved they could do it. And from everything I know, nobody cut any slack for them. They did it.
And in fact, after it was over, they interviewed some of the, you know, male competitors...
MATTHEWS: Right.
CLINTON: ... to go through Ranger school, and these guys said, You know, after a while, I didn't even notice. I mean, yes, you're right, she was a woman. She carried her weight. She pulled her own.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: That's what you want because I think about the job that I'm applying for, and it really is a job interview that I'm doing all over America.
MATTHEWS: Commander-in-chief.
CLINTON: President and commander-in-chief. And I feel ready to fulfill both roles. I think it's important that the next president get the economy working for everybody so that we don't keep having the deck stacked for those on the top. We've got to stay safe at home and strong in the world. And we've got to deal with these problems that keep people up at night, I like to say.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: I feel particularly well prepared to do every part of the job. And when it comes to being commander-in-chief, my eight years as a senator from New York after 9/11, my four years as secretary of state, my many, many hours in the Situation Room, I know how hard these choices are.
MATTHEWS: You were there when Osama was killed.
CLINTON: I was. You know, I was one of the very few people that was brought in to advise the president.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: And it was the most...
MATTHEWS: You said, Go for it.
CLINTON: I did. I did, you know, after, as I say, sitting through hours of meetings, listening to the intelligence being presented, listening to Admiral McRaven, who was then the head of special forces, talk about, you know, what special forces could do, looking at other options...
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: ... like a cruise missile or a Predator—armed predator, and recommending to the president that we go with the Navy SEAL option, and then being there that day, watching part of the operation on a video screen in the Situation Room, just holding my breath literally through the whole thing.
I know how hard these choices are. And I know what a cool, deliberative head needs to be finally making them.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: I have learned so much, Chris, over the last years. I feel very ready.
MATTHEWS: You have the—you know who said you had the temperament for it? Bill Clinton, which I thought was interesting, because he would know your temperament.
CLINTON: Yes. Yes.
MATTHEWS: Let me ask about your sort of position on this. You voted for the Iraq War authorization, if not the war.
Bernie Sanders is out there still hitting you on that one. Of course, he's coming from the left on you. You have got Rand Paul out there, who is a libertarian and a bit of a—I would say a bit of a dove, saying that you would be more for regime change, that you would start the next war.
CLINTON: Yes. Well, he's wrong. He is wrong.
MATTHEWS: They're positioning you as to the hawkish side of Obama.
CLINTON: Yes. Right.
MATTHEWS: How—where would you—you read Fred Hiatt of ""The Washington Post"" the other day...
CLINTON: Yes.
MATTHEWS: ... position you as someone, I thought, a notch to the hawkish side, because he said you were for a no-fly zone in Syria. You were for ground troops, but not necessarily our troops, but some...
CLINTON: Right.
MATTHEWS: Because you need a ground component to tell the bombs where to—to tell them where to drop the bombs.
CLINTON: Right. Exactly. Right.
MATTHEWS: Does that make you more hawkish than the president?
CLINTON: Well, I think most of what I have been advocating, the president is now doing.
MATTHEWS: But not that.
CLINTON: Well, we have special forces on the ground. He sent them.
MATTHEWS: But no-fly zone?
CLINTON: But the no-fly zone, for me, was an idea that I developed with some advisers.
MATTHEWS: Is it dangerous with the Russians flying around there?
CLINTON: Well, of course you would have to have the Russians to sign off on it.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: And we were making progress.
I don't know what the result will be of the conflict now between Saudi Arabia and Iran. But, you know, for the last four years, we have been pushing to try to get a peace conference going.
And I give Secretary Kerry credit for getting everybody agreeing to be in the same room. I saw the no-fly zone as leverage. Number one, if we could get the Russians on board, because we would have to—and I think we could, if we were to say, look, we need safe zones. If we're going to be operating on the ground, advising the Kurds, the Arabs, we need safe zones.
We also need safe places for civilians, so that they're not refugees leaving Iraq and Syria. And it can be done. It can be done in a way that doesn't create more problems.
But now I'm—I'm very supportive of what the president's doing. We're making some progress. And I have been calling for that, calling for reconstituting the approach toward the sheiks, the Sunni sheiks in Anbar Province, getting them back into the fight, so to speak.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: They are. Rebuilding the Iraqi army.
MATTHEWS: Yes. That's what we need.
CLINTON: We need that.
MATTHEWS: We need the Sunnis to retake their land, because the Shia can't do it.
CLINTON: We need the—well, the still largely Shia Iraqi army took Ramadi, but with Sunni troops.
MATTHEWS: Army. They have to turn it over to Sunnis.
CLINTON: And then turn it over.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: This makes all the sense in the world to me.
So, I view myself as being a realist, being practical, and in accordance with our values, because I think it's very important that we get back to promoting our values and pursuing our interests and protecting our security.
If the United States doesn't do that on our own behalf or on behalf of our friends in Europe and Asia and the Middle East, no one will. So this is not a choice. It's not a luxury. It's a necessity.
MATTHEWS: OK. Last question. We're running out of time.
I want to try to help you for this audience tonight, our audience, locate yourself politically in this country. [laughter]
Now, we have Trump out there and we have Bernie out here.
Now, Bernie calls himself a socialist. Nobody uses a derogatory term anymore. It's—he loves to have that label. He's never ran as a Democrat. He runs against Democrats up there in Vermont.
You're a Democrat. I would say you're a pretty typical Democrat in the tradition of the Democratic Party, and Humphrey, the rest of them, Scoop—not even Scoop. I would say Mondale. You're somewhere in there.
What's the difference between a socialist and a Democrat?
CLINTON: Well, you have to...
MATTHEWS: Is that a question you want to answer, or would you rather not?
[crosstalk]
CLINTON: Well, you would have to ask...
[crosstalk]
MATTHEWS: Well, see, I'm asking you. You're a Democrat. He's a socialist. Would you like somebody to call you a socialist? I wouldn't like somebody calling me a socialist.
CLINTON: Well, but I'm not one. I'm not one.
MATTHEWS: OK. Well, what's the difference between a socialist and a Democrat? Last question.
CLINTON: Well, I can tell you what I am.
I am a progressive Democrat. I am a progressive Democrat...
MATTHEWS: How is that different than a socialist?
CLINTON: ... who likes to get things done and who believes that we're better off in this country when we're trying to solve problems together, getting people to work together.
There will always be strong feelings, and I respect that, from, you know, the far right, the far left, libertarians, whatever—whoever it might be. We need to get people working together. We have got to get the economy fixed. We have got to get all of our problems, you know, really tackled. And that's what I want to do.
MATTHEWS: I know.
Yes, I think the difference is—and Debbie Wasserman Schultz wouldn't answer the question either I asked her, because I know, politically, you have to keep together. The center-left and the left has to work together. I know all that.
Let me ask you about working together. You gave a nice speech here today in Osage about the need to work—I wrote a book about Tip and Reagan. When it comes to an urgent issue, they can find a solution.
CLINTON: Right.
MATTHEWS: Obama—I have always supported the president on his philosophy, on his general approach to a lot of things.
But he doesn't seem to like the company of fellow politicians. He just doesn't. He doesn't want to hang out with them, play cards with them at midnight. Maybe he did it in Springfield. For some reason, he doesn't want to do it in Washington.
You seem to like the company of people like Lindsey Graham and John McCain. And you can find a way, go on CODELs with them and getting along with them. And it seems to me that is an important part of life, that you have to find—you were talking about Tom DeLay here.
And I get along with Tom DeLay. Even though you disagree 180 on something, you have got to find—Congress means coming together.
CLINTON: Yes. Well, your book is a perfect example of...
MATTHEWS: ""Tip and the Gipper.""
CLINTON: Exactly. And, look, there may be...
MATTHEWS: You read it?
CLINTON: I did.
MATTHEWS: Thank you.
CLINTON: I don't—I don't want you to know that, but I did.
MATTHEWS: But you have just told me that. I like this. You're throwing me an encomium here. [laughter]
CLINTON: No, because I—because I am always looking for ways that we work together.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: And it used to be easier in the past.
MATTHEWS: It did.
CLINTON: I think that the polarization has gotten so acute now, and so you have to work even harder. But relationships are the beginning of everything.
MATTHEWS: So, you could imagine, if you're fortunate to become the next president of the United States, having people over to the White House, not going to the Jefferson Hotel for an hour-and-a-half, but actually having people come over and talk it over?
CLINTON: Yes, well...
MATTHEWS: By the way, you're an empty nester, so it's easier for you.
CLINTON: It is easier.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: It is much easier.
And, look, everybody has strengths that they bring to this position. And, obviously...
MATTHEWS: Is schmoozing one of yours?
CLINTON: Well, I think that I like it, because I am looking for that common ground somewhere.
MATTHEWS: Yes. Yes.
CLINTON: And I don't think that you get it just on the first try.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: You have got to listen to people. You got to get to know people. You got to look for ways that you can reach across the aisle.
MATTHEWS: Yes.
CLINTON: I'm not saying it's going to be magic, because part of what's happened—and it is different from when Tip O'Neill and President Reagan were working together—it is so much more gerrymandered. It's so much more influenced...
MATTHEWS: I know. You don't have any Republicans in a Democratic district.
CLINTON: Not anymore.
MATTHEWS: You don't have any Democrats in a Republican district.
CLINTON: And so people don't feel like they have to make deals.
MATTHEWS: OK. I have been telling people for years that, when they're with you personally, you're very different and you're very easy to talk to. [laughter]
I think, watching you the last 20 minutes, they get the point.
CLINTON: Thank you.
MATTHEWS: I think this has been a great interview. And I appreciate you for coming on and giving us the time.
CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chris. Great to see you.
MATTHEWS: Thank you, Madam Secretary.

26,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5000,"January 10, 2016","Interview with John Dickerson of CBS News ""Face the Nation""",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111431,Hillary Clinton,"DICKERSON: We're going to get right to our lead guest, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is in Chappaqua, New York, this morning.
Good morning, Secretary Clinton.
I want to start with politics. We're going to talk about a lot today, but let's start with politics. A new NBC/""Wall Street Journal""/Marist poll says in Iowa it's 48-45, you over Sanders. You were once way ahead. So, what's happening?
CLINTON: Oh, John, you know these polls go up, they go down.
I stay pretty focused, as I think we all should, on what we have to do to build on the progress of the Obama administration, but go even further. And that's why I have outlined a very significant agenda to raise wages and to take on the gun lobby and to be making America safe in every way that I can.
And those are some of the differences that I have with my primary opponents, and certainly very deep differences with all the Republicans running.
DICKERSON: This week, another batch of your e-mails were released by the State Department.
One of them is a back-and-forth between you and a staffer about a secure fax that won't come through. And you directed him to -- quote -- ""turn into non-paper with no identifying heading and send nonsecure.""
Aren't you ordering him to violate the laws on handling classified material there?
CLINTON: No, not at all.
And as the State Department said just this week, that did not happen. And it never would have happened, because that's just not the way I treated classified information. Headings are not classification notices. And so, oftentimes, we're trying to get the best information we can.
And, obviously, what I'm asking for is whatever can be transmitted, if it doesn't come through secure, to be transmitted on the unclassified system. So, no, there is nothing to that, like so much else that has been talked about in the last year.
DICKERSON: So, in no instance -- what is striking about that particular e-mail is it suggests you were very facile with how to do this, this process. You knew the instructions about how to get around the restrictions for sending classified information.
So you're saying there was never an instance, any other instance in which you did that?
CLINTON: No. And it wasn't sent. So, I think this is another instance where what is common practice -- namely, look, I need information. I had some points I had to make. And I was looking for a secure fax that could give me the whole picture.
But, oftentimes, there's a lot of information that isn't at all classified. So, whatever information can appropriately transmitted unclassified often was. That's true for every agency in the government and who everybody does business with the government.
But the important point here is, I had great confidence, because I had worked with Jake Sullivan for years. He is the most meticulous, careful person you could possibly do business with. And he knew exactly what was and wasn't appropriate.
And, in fact, as the State Department has said, there was no transmission of any classified information. So, it's another effort by people looking for something to throw against the wall, as you said in the beginning of the program, to see what sticks. But there's no there there.
DICKERSON: Well, this one is a little different, since the FBI is investigating this specific question of whether a classification was meddled with.
Let me ask you about another e-mail in this batch, which was one in which you seemed to express surprise that somebody e-mailed on their non-State Department personal e-mail, which is what you were doing. Why was that a surprise to you?
CLINTON: Well, I e-mailed two people on their government accounts, because I knew that all of that would be part of the government system.
And, indeed, the vast majority of all my e-mails are in the government system. So, that's how I conducted the business. I was very clear about e-mailing anything having to do with business to people on their government accounts.
DICKERSON: On gun control this week, you have been pretty tough on Bernie Sanders, specifically on the question of legal protection to gun manufacturers.
He has now said that he would be interested in looking to changing the law to allow -- to go after gun manufacturers who act irresponsibly. So, isn't that what you want?
CLINTON: No, that's not what I want. And that's not what the country wants. And that's not what President Obama called for. And I think he has been consistently refusing to say that he would vote to repeal this absolute immunity from any kind of responsibility or liability.
It's the only industry in our country where we have given that kind of carte blanche to do whatever you want to do with no fear of legal consequences. You know, President Obama and I and Senator Sanders were all in the Senate at the same time. Two of us voted against what the NRA says was the most important piece of legislation in 20 years for the gun lobby. Senator Sanders voted with them, and through this morning has been unwilling to join the president and me in saying that this should be repealed. That has to be the effort that we all are behind. And he often says, well, look, I'm from Vermont and it's different. It's not like being in New York City.
Well, in fact, the other senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, voted with President Obama and myself. So, I think that the excuses and efforts by Senator Sanders to avoid responsibility for this vote, which the NRA hailed as the most important in 20 years, points up a clear difference.
And it's a difference that Democratic voters in our primary can take into account. Who is going to really stand up to the gun lobby, try to deal with the scourge of gun violence that takes 90 people's lives a day? I'm pretty clear on what I will do. And I support and will work hard to implement what the president has been advocating.
DICKERSON: On Senator Sanders' response, this idea that he represents a state which there are lot of gun owners, you were a senator. You -- aren't you sympathetic to that? You said you represented Wall Street, and that's what shaped your views on certain Wall Street policy. And you have suggested that, as president, you would be different than you did as senator, when you were representing a state with a constituency.
CLINTON: Well...
DICKERSON: So, why isn't it fair for Bernie Sanders to say, as president, I would be different than I would as a senator representing a state with a lot of gun owners?
CLINTON: Well, you know, I think you have really mixed up two important issues here.
I have been consistent on gun lobby restrictions. In fact, I supported the Brady Bill. Senator Sanders voted against it five times. So, there is a very clear difference.
And when it comes to Wall Street, yes, I represented New York. And I was proud to do so. And I took on Wall Street. I'm the person who came out against derivatives. I'm the person who came out calling for restrictions on CEO pay, which, thankfully, got into the Dodd- Frank bill.
I'm the person who went to Wall Street and actually confronted them in 2007. I called them out on the role they were playing in the mortgage market. So, I do have a history of taking on what I consider to be the abuses that come from any industry, including Wall Street.
And I will continue to do so as president. And the proposal that I have put forth about how we rein in the excesses of Wall Street, so we never again face what we did in 2008, has been judged as being more comprehensive, tougher, more effective by Barney Frank, by Sherrod Brown, my friend from Ohio who leads the banking efforts in the Senate, and by Paul Krugman. So, I have plan that will go after not just the big banks, because Dodd-Frank has given us the tools to do a lot of that, but to go after the so-called shadow banking industry.
DICKERSON: Right.
CLINTON: And I think I'm well-prepared. I know what needs to be done. It's kind of like Nixon going to China, John.
DICKERSON: All right, Senator, let me ask you about a general election opponent you may face. That is Donald Trump.
You got into a pretty ugly exchange. You charged that he -- you charged him with sexism, and then he put out an Instagram video of your husband and Monica Lewinsky. Your reaction to that?
CLINTON: Well, if he wants to engage in personal attacks from the past, that's his prerogative. You know, so be it.
I'm going to draw the distinctions between where I stand and where he stands when it comes to equal pay for women, raising the minimum wage, which affects two-thirds of the women, who are the ones receiving the minimum wage, protecting a woman's right to make the most personal health care decisions.
That's why I'm so proud to have the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund that I received today in New Hampshire, because I'm going to fight as hard as I can against any efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, something that he supports.
So, there are very clear distinctions. He can say whatever he wants to about me. Let the voters judge that. But I am not going to let him or any of the other Republicans rip away the progress that women have made. It's been too hard-fought-for. And I'm going to stand up and make it clear there's a huge difference between us.
DICKERSON: Secretary Clinton, what do you say, though, to those even in your own party who say that -- a discussion of that portion of your husband's career is fair game to talk about in an election?
CLINTON: Well, it's been fair game going back to the Republicans for some years. They can do it again if they want to. That can be their choice as to how to run in this campaign. Didn't work before. It won't work again, because it is what people are focused on, not for the past, but for the future.
What are we going to do to get wages rising? What are we going to do to create more good jobs? What are we going to do keep rights? What are we going to do to make sure that the Supreme Court has people on it who will defend women's rights, who will defend marriage equality, who will defend voter rights?
So, I can't run anybody else's campaign. They can say whatever they want. More power to them. I think it's a dead end, blind alley for them, but let them go. I'm going to talk about the differences between us, because I think that's what Americans care about. DICKERSON: Secretary Clinton, I'm afraid we're at a dead end ourselves and out of time. [laughter]
DICKERSON: Thanks so much for being with us.
CLINTON: Thanks. Let's continue the conversation, John.
DICKERSON: See you out there.

27,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5000,"January 13, 2016",Interview with Alisyn Camerota of CNN,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111432,Hillary Clinton,"CAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, thanks so much for sitting down with us here in Iowa.
CLINTON: Thank you, Alisyn.
CAMEROTA: We are in Ames, Iowa --
CLINTON: Yes.
CAMEROTA:—where the temperature as we speak is one degree.
CLINTON: Uh-hm.
CAMEROTA: And I know that you have been going to countless campaign events here and I'm wondering when you get up in the morning in Iowa if there are ever times you question your life choices?
CLINTON: Absolutely, no. You know, I grew up in Chicago. I'm used to cold weather. It doesn't bother me. In fact, I'm somewhat reassured that there is a real winter, that we are actually seeing snow and lower temperatures. But I get up every day whether I'm in Iowa, in New Hampshire, wherever I am in the country and I really look forward to the day because I find the opportunity to go out and listen to people, hear their stories, give them my views about what I think the next president should do very energizing and very, you know, reinvigorating all the time.
CAMEROTA: So, let's talk about the tightening race between you and Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is speaking to reporters on Monday night here in Iowa. And he said that your campaign is in, quote, ""serious trouble."" Is that how you feel?
CLINTON: Not at all. In fact, I have always known that if you are going to run to be president, particularly in the Democratic Party, it's a long, hard, challenging road. And so I've been in these elections before. They always tighten up as people begin to make up their minds, as they look at the candidates, totally predictable. I feel really, really good about the campaign organization that I have. A caucus is different from a primary. It takes a lot of intensive work to convince people to come out on a cold Monday night, spend a couple of hours in order to stand up for your candidate, but I'm asking Iowans if they'll stand up for me on caucus night. I will be standing up for them all through my presidency.
CAMEROTA: There is a new Quinnipiac poll out just about one hour ago in which Bernie Sanders is now beating you in Iowa. It is 49 percent to 44 percent. It is the first time that this has happened that he's been beating you in Iowa since September. We are 20 days out. Does he have more momentum than you?
CLINTON: Well, the funny thing Alisyn is, after that poll came out about an hour later there was a PPP poll where I was leading him by the same margin about six points up. I don't pay any attention to this. I don't feel that it's a good reflection about who will actually come out on caucus night. I can only tell you that the energy, the enthusiasm, the excitement of my volunteers, my organizers, the voters who come, who sign up on commit to caucus cards is just building. That's my experience. So I'll let people poll and try to figure out who is going to show up. I'm looking at people who are showing up, making up their minds and trying to, you know, convince them to come out and caucus for me.
CAMEROTA: Why don't you feel that the polls are good reflection of what's going to happen in the caucus?
CLINTON: Because they are so unpredictable. And it's gotten increasingly difficult to poll. And I think you would have to add a degree of difficulty to polling for a caucus. So, that's been my experience. I've watched this a long time. I've had a prior election where I campaigned in Iowa. So, I just put that aside. I'll let pundits and others worry about who's up and who's down. I just get up every day like we were saying, going out there, making my case, drawing the contrast because I have the highest regard for my two opponents, but there are real differences. And we need a spirited debate. Because after the first of the year, a lot more people start paying attention. And now I know it's, you know, the make or break time, people make up their minds.
CAMEROTA: Bernie Sanders is also winning in New Hampshire. Not surprising. He is from a neighboring state. Have you considered what would happen if he wins in Iowa and New Hampshire what your plan is?
CLINTON: I don't think about that. I'm going to do everything I can to win as bigger margin as possible in the caucus and then go to the primary. But this is a national campaign. We've been organizing in South Carolina, in Nevada, a lot of the March 1st states, the March 15th states. Remember, I campaigned all the way into June last time. And I have always thought that given the unpredictability and the, you know, changes in people's concerns going into this election, that we wouldn't know exactly how the outcome would be for, you know, a couple of cycles of these primaries and caucuses. So, I'm going to do my best to convince more Iowans to come out and caucus for me. And even though as you say, Senator Sanders as a neighbor and a neighbor never lost in New Hampshire, I'm going to take that challenge on and do the best I can to get people in New Hampshire to support me, as well.
CAMEROTA: Vice President Joe Biden offered his thoughts to CNN on why he thinks Bernie Sanders is resonating. He said that he thinks it's about Senator Sanders' positions on income inequality. And the Vice President said, quote, ""It's relatively new for Hillary to talk about that. That's been Bernie's. No one questions Bernie's authenticity on those issues."" What's your reaction?
CLINTON: Well, the Vice President who I deeply respect and regard as a friend, went on to say as I recall. But, you know, Hillary Clinton has a lot of very good economic policies that are thoughtful and on and on. Look, I have been working toward closing the gaps between people, poor people and well-off people primarily all my adult life. I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. I helped to reform the education system in Arkansas. I was a legal services lawyer defending poor people. I went to work to try to make sure that we got health care in the beginning of my husband's administration because of so many people who were left out and were uninsured.
I have been on this issue in many different ways. How do we make education more equal? How do we make health care more equal? Of course that's tied to income equality, but there is also a broader range of issues that I have a long record of addressing. And when I was in the Senate I took on corporate executive pay. A lot of the abuses that I thought were there. I took on these derivatives and credit default swaps that contributed to the collapse of the economy and the great recession. I stood up to Wall Street. I called them out. So I have a very long record. I have a broader agenda. It's not the only thing I talk about because I think you have to view equality of opportunity and how we deliver that in the 21st Century for many different perspectives and that's what I tried to do.
CAMEROTA: And since you have been devoting much of your career to talking about this, why do you think the Vice President would say, it's more in Bernie's wheelhouse and it's about his authenticity?
CLINTON: Oh, I don't know. But you know, I have a lot of regard for the vice president. And I think today he clarified what he said and said he was talking about me when I was Secretary of State. Well, when I was Secretary of State, I couldn't talk about domestic policy. There is an unwritten rule, you do not meddle in domestic policy when you are secretary of state or for that matter, secretary of defense. So yes, for four years, despite a long career both in and out of public service where I have been relentless in talking about these issues, there were four years when I did not. I talked about how we were going to get Iran to the negotiating table and try to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon, how we're going to, you know, deal with a rising China, what we're going to do about women's rights, something that goes to the heart of inequality. So, I had a different agenda because I had a different job.
CAMEROTA: So, you didn't take Biden's comments as a slight?
CLINTON: No. Not at all.
CAMEROTA: OK. You are introducing your tax plan. One of the headlines is that you would impose a four percent surcharge on incomes over $5 million. And I believe that that would raise about $150 billion over ten years. Does that go far enough in addressing income inequality?
CLINTON: Well, we've got a variety of proposals. Not only the four percent surcharge which I call the fair share surcharge. The so-called Buffet Rule which would have a minimum tax rate for people making more than $1 million, limiting deductions to 28 percent with a charitable exception. Going after a lot of the subsidies that, for example, still subsidize the oil and gas industry about $6 billion a year while we have to move toward a clean renewable energy future. So I have put forth plans, paid family leave, tuition, debt-free tuition for public colleges.
Capping prescription drug costs and much more. And it would cost about $100 billion a year, all of which I pay for. In contrast, Senator Sanders has some very big ideas, but he hasn't yet told anybody how he would pay for them. And he had promised that he would roll out his tax plans before the Iowa caucus on February 1st. Well, if you wait too long, nobody will have a chance to see them or analyze them. And so I am very clear about what I would do and how I would pay for it.
CAMEROTA: Another point of conflict between you and Senator Sanders is on gun policy.
CLINTON: Uh-hm.
CAMEROTA: We just watched this very emotional event this morning.
CLINTON: Yes.
CAMEROTA: That you were involved in where this mom who lost two children --
CLINTON: Right --
CAMEROTA:—to gun violence got up and spoke. And it was really heartbreaking to hear her. It sounds like she lost her children to criminals.
CLINTON: Yes.
CAMEROTA: So, how would you stop that?
CLINTON: This is a very big difference in this campaign. Because as you saw, I received the Brady campaign endorsement today and both the woman Delfin Cherry who introduced us to the stage and the head of the Brady campaign had lost family members. It was really hard standing up there because I have held the hands of and listened to countless people who have lost family members to gun violence. And I agree completely with the President about us having to take action now. We lose on an average 90 people a day. It has to stop, Alisyn. I've been in this campaign advocating for comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online loophole, closing what's called the Charleston loophole.
You know, there was a loophole, my opponent voted for it, Senator Sanders, that at the end of three days, business days, you get that gun whether they have finished the background check or not. The killer in Charleston who bought that gun, if there had just been a little more time, it would have been discovered he should not have been able to buy the gun because he had a federal record. We have saved a lot of lives. I can't put an exact number on it. But because of the Brady bill which Senator Sanders voted against five times, more than two million people, the Brady campaign says, 2.4 million purchasers have been stopped from buying guns.
So, we are talking about violent criminals. We are talking about domestic abusers. We are talking about the dangerously mentally ill. We are even talking about terrorists because the Republicans won't close the loophole so that people on the no fly zone can buy guns. I feel passionately about this. And the cumulation from Sandy Hook to the community college in Oregon, the fact that we have so many mass killings in the last few years, I think it certainly motivated the President, and I am so proud to support him and I want to make this a voting issue in this campaign.
[break]
CAMEROTA: I want to talk about an issue Donald Trump wanted to make an issue in this campaign, that is—are allegations from your husband's past. He is going further actually than that. He is making it about you. He is saying that you are an enabler of bad behavior and of sexual assault.
What's your response to Donald Trump?
CLINTON: I have no response. I'm going to let him say whatever he wants to say. He can run his campaign however he wishes. I'm going to keep talking about what the next president will have to do starting January 20th, 2017.
I have deep disagreements with what he's proposing. His tax plans would cut trillions of dollars of taxes from the wealthy and corporations. He doesn't believe in equal pay. He thinks that American workers are already making too much.
So, I'm going to draw the contrast with him that I think the American people are interested in seeing.
CAMEROTA: But when someone accuses you of being an enabler of sexual assault, don't you need to respond to it? I mean, particularly since this is an issue you wanted to talk about on the campaign trail. Can't this sexual assault—you say survivors need to be believed and they need to be heard.
So, when he's accusing you of doing something that is the antithesis of what you want to talk about, don't you need to address it?
CLINTON: I'm going to let the American voters decide what's relevant and what's not relevant in their decision as to who they're going to support.
CAMEROTA: I have a few more questions. Donald Trump was on ""The Tonight Show"" and asked about the possibility of you two running against each other, if that's how this all plays out in November. He said that would be, quote, ""an amazing thing."" [laughter]
CLINTON: Yes, it would be amazing. I would look forward to it.
Look, I think this is serious business. Campaigns always have some great stories and great characters. That's part of the political process. This is really serious business, who the next president is. We are either going to build on the progress that we've made or we're going to see it ripped away. We are either going to defend human rights and civil rights and women's rights and gay rights and voting rights and workers' rights and all the rest that is at stake, or we are going to turn the clock back.
And that's why I have tried to very clearly explain where I stand on all of these issues because the stakes are so high. And if I'm fortunate enough to get the nomination, I will run hard against whomever the Republicans' nominee, because they represent a brand of politics and policies that I think would hurt our country. I don't want to see that happen.
CAMEROTA: Let's say you get the nomination. Let's say you win the presidency.
CLINTON: Yes, let's say that.
CAMEROTA: Let's say it.
And on day one, you walk into the Oval Office, what's the first phone call you make?
CLINTON: Well, I think the very first phone call would be to whoever I've asked to be the chief of staff of the White House. Let's get a meeting together, let's get our agenda together. There's a lot we have to get going. The earlier we start, the better we'll be off and we'll get more accomplished.
Because I want to really think hard if I do get the nomination, right then and there, how we organize the White House, how we organize the cabinet. What's the legislative agenda?
You know, the time between an election and inauguration is short. You can't wait. I mean, you can't take anything for granted. You have to keep working as hard as you possibly can, but I think it's important to start planning because we know what happens if you get behind in getting your agenda out and getting your appointments made. You lose time. And you're not doing the work that the American people elected you to do.
CAMEROTA: Before I let you go, I definitely want to ask you about your granddaughter. You talk about her on the campaign trail. Today is I believe or recently, Chelsea is making her first appearance on the campaign trail.
CLINTON: Yes.
CAMEROTA: She said she believes that you becoming a grandmother is a driving force behind your campaign. How so?
CLINTON: Well, she's right, because I feel very fortunate. I like to point out I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker who came to this country as a young immigrant. Went to work in the lace mills in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
So, here I am three generations later asking people to vote for me to become their president. And we have this amazing 15-month-old grandchild with another on the way next summer. And so, I think a lot about the future, but I think not just about her future because we're going to do everything we can to make sure she has the best opportunities life can offer, but I think about what kind of country she'll become an adult in and what kind of world is going to be waiting for her.
I want to make sure—it's not just our grandchild, but every child who has the opportunity to go as far to fulfill their God-given potential as possible. And a lot of that depends on the kinds of decisions that our presidents make. It's not, you know, you have to have family support, you have to have community support.
I wrote a book called ""It Takes A Village."" I understand that. Do you kids have health care? That's why I created the children's health care insurance program, because too many didn't. Your kids have good education, that's why I'm for early childhood, because too many kids come to school unprepared. How about college affordability? Too many kids are weeded out because they can't afford to start or stay.
I go through the list of what is really dampening the opportunities that young people in our country have right now. And I want to be the president who unleashes that potential again.
CAMEROTA: And when you think about your grandchildren's future, are you worried or hopeful?
CLINTON: I'm always hopeful, Alisyn. I'm always hopeful. I think this is the greatest country.
When I listen to the negative comments made about our country on the campaign stage predominantly by the Republicans, I mean, look at what we've come back from. It was a Republican administration under which we had the Great Recession. That is just a fact.
President Obama inherited an economy that was losing 800,000 jobs a month. I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for digging us out and getting us standing again. So, I know that choices really matter in politics, but I am absolutely committed to the belief, the conviction that I have that our country is resilient, we're strong, we're smart.
Given the right leadership, we can do anything. That's why I actually am quite optimistic and confident about the future.
CAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, thank you so much.
CLINTON: Thank you, Alisyn.
CAMEROTA: Great to talk to you.
CLINTON: It's great to see you.

28,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5000,"January 17, 2016","Interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News ""This Week""",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111433,Hillary Clinton,"STEPHANOPOULOS: Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton going at it this week as we begin this campaign in 2016 just two weeks from the Iowa caucuses.
Secretary Clinton joins us now from Charleston, South Carolina, ahead of tonight's big debate.
Good morning, Madam Secretary.
CLINTON: Good morning, George.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to get to that back and forth between you and Bernie Sanders, but first the news that the American hostages from Iran are heading home this morning. Donald Trump not giving the president any credit and Marco Rubio says it's going to create incentives for other U.S. adversaries to take hostages.
Does he have a point?
CLINTON: Well, look, I'm pleased, like I hope everybody is, that we have American citizens coming home this morning from Iran. They were unjustly held there, and I did a lot of work on these issues when Americans were being picked up, falsely charged and imprisoned, to get them home. So I applaud the fact that that's happened.
We still don't see Bob Levinson coming home, so we have unfinished questions and business still. But I think this is a part of what we're going to be pursuing—persistent, patient diplomacy.
Today's also the day that we have verified the Iranians have followed through on the requirements under the nuclear agreement. They have shipped out the vast majority, I think it's up to 98 percent, of their enriched uranium. They have poured cement into one of the reactors we worried about because of a plutonium potential threat. They have destroyed centrifuges.
So this is the kind of smart diplomacy I was proud to be a part of in the first administration of President Obama that we're just going to have to be persistent with, because we have a lot of problems with Iran—their aggressive behavior, their destabilizing of neighboring states, their continuing military support for Assad and so much else.
But the fact that we've put the lid on the nuclear weapons program, the fact that we got our prisoners back, I think is a reason for good news.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's get to the campaign right now.
A strange series of events yesterday. The super PAC coordinating with you put out word that they'd be demanding to release of Bernie Sanders' health records. Sanders campaign struck back, calling that vile. Your campaign disavowed it. It appeared to go away.
So what is relevant here and what's not?
Should age and health be an issue in this campaign?
CLINTON: Oh, look, you know, I put out my medical records. I think you've been around long enough to know, George, this is all part of the expectation.
But I think it's fair to say that I share a lot of the same goals with Senator Sanders about what we need to do on behalf of our country. But we have differences. And that's what I'm focusing on now. We're going to have a spirited debate, I expect, tonight in Charleston. Certainly Senator Sanders has been pointing out differences.
And one of the issues that I have drawn a very stark contrast on has been guns.
You know, I have pointed out repeatedly, because I think it's a critical issue, that Senator Sanders has, for years, voted many times on behalf of the NRA gun lobby position. And one of the most egregious of those votes was the vote to give immunity from all liability to gun makers and sellers. Now, I was happy when -
STEPHANOPOULOS: He now supports taking that away.
CLINTON: Well, he flip-flopped last night, said that he would sign on to a bill that is currently pending in the House and Senate to repeal that liability. And I'm delighted that he has had a change of heart. I think that's all for the good.
Now I hope he will take a hard look at what we call the Charleston loophole. That's a provision he also voted for, that gives a gun to a potential buyer after three days whether or not the background check has been completed. And it's called the Charleston loophole because that's how the killer in Charleston got his gun when, if there had been a little more time, information would have come to light that would have shown he was prohibited. And, of course, we know he used that gun to go to Mother Emanuel Church and murder nine faithful people at Bible study.
So I want to see movement against the gun lobby, because we cannot continue to lose 90 people a day, 33,000 a year, to gun violence. And I welcome Senator Sanders moving on one of the issues he was wrong on. I hope he will continue to move.
STEPHANOPOULOS: And we're going to ask him about that in a few minutes.
Another big difference on health care. He wants to replace Obamacare with a single payer system, Medicare for all.
So are you against that because it's a bad idea or because it's not practical? Would a single payer system be better if you could get it passed?
CLINTON: Well, first, I share the goal of universal health care. You know very well that I threw myself into that back in '93 and '94 and still have the scars to show for it. So the goal is we want everybody to have access to quality, affordable health care. But I think we should be defending the Affordable Care Act. This is a historic achievement for our country. It certainly is for President Obama. We are making progress. I want us to protect it, to defend it and to improve it.
The Republicans keep trying to repeal it and offer nothing in place of it. So rather than tear it apart or get rid of it and start all over again in a contentious national debate, let's do what I'm proposing, to get costs down, get out of pocket costs down, get more support for families who face big medical costs. Let's deal with the rising cost of prescription drugs. That, I think, is the right way for the country to go and it certainly is what I'm advocating.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You also have your differences over Wall Street. We've heard a little bit of that going into this. And I was struck this morning, American Crossroads, a super PAC founded by Karl Rove, who, of course, worked for President George W. Bush, has just launched this online ad in Iowa.
[begin video clip]
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hillary Clinton's gotten 54 times more money from Wall Street interests than from all of Iowa. Hillary rewarded Wall Street with the $700 billion bailout. Then Wall Street made her a multi-millionaire.
CLINTON: I represented Wall Street.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Huh, you sure did, Hillary.
[end video clip]
STEPHANOPOULOS: Now, that echoes the points being made by Bernie Sanders in his campaign.
Are you worried that your ties to Wall Street are weighing you down?
CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I think it shows how desperate the Republicans are to prevent me from becoming the nominee. I find that, in a perverse way, an incredibly flattering comment on their anxiety, because they know that not only will I stand up for what the country needs, I will take it to the Republicans. I have a track record which shows I know how to stand up to them. And I will win.
So I think this just proves my point, that I am the strongest candidate to go up against any Republican.
With the back and forth on Wall Street, I think it's, you know, look, I have stood up to Wall Street even though I did represent New York. I have advocated for changes. But what I find sort of strange is, number one, the ad that Senator Sanders ran was really against all Democrats who ever took any contributions from anybody associated with the financial industry. That would include President Obama, who took more anyone ever had in 2008. That did not stop him from turning around and imposing the toughest rules on Wall Street since the 1930s. The same with Barney Frank, who has actually written about this.
You know, that is just a false charge.
But in addition, I think it's important for us to look at our respective plans. In fact, everyone who has offered an opinion about the plan that Senator Sanders has proposed and the one I put together has said mine is tougher, mine is more comprehensive, it would be more effective, because it tries to get not just at the problems of yesterday, but the potential problems of tomorrow, going after shadow banking and investment banks and big insurance companies, like what we saw in '08 where Lehman Brothers and AIG were principal causes of what happened to us.
And I think, finally, I would say that I have gotten maybe 3 percent of my - less than 3 percent of my contributions this time from anybody associated with financial industry activities. I've gotten so much more from students and teachers. Ninety percent of my contributions are from smaller donors and 60 percent from women.
So I'm just - you know, I didn't know about Karl Rove's ad against me, but it kind of boosts me up, because I assume he thinks that I am going to get the nomination and he's trying to interfere with the Iowa caucus to maybe confuse people on their way to caucus for me.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Madam Secretary, thanks very much for your time this morning.
CLINTON: Thank you.
Good to talk to you, George.

29,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5000,"January 17, 2016","Interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News ""Meet the Press""",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111434,Hillary Clinton,"TODD: But we start with the Democrats and a Hillary Clinton/Bernie Sanders race that has turned out to be much closer than the experts thought especially the Clinton campaign.
In fact, we have some brand new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll numbers out this morning and it does have some good news for the Clinton campaign. Nationally we still have her with a big lead over Bernie Sanders 59 percent-34 percent.
But in Iowa the story has been very different. Three polls out this week alone showing neck and neck race including our own NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls which had Clinton leading by jut 3; Quinnipiac found Sanders actually up by 5 and the ""Des Moines Register"" had Clinton up by just 2. Bottom line, it's too close to call.
So as they close the race it has become a more aggressive race against Sanders so we begin with Hillary Clinton who joins Clinton campaign against Sanders and so we begin with Hillary Clinton who joins us from Charleston, South Carolina. Good morning—Secretary Clinton.
CLINTON: Good morning, Chuck.
TODD: Let me start with the Iran deal. Yesterday in response to it you immediately said that Iran is still violating U.N. Security Council resolutions with its ballistic missile program which should be met with new sanctions, designations and firm results.
So I guess my question is what do you tell the American public that says you want new sanctions against Iran, they're still violating agreement and yet what did we do? We just handed them $100 billion and we just did a prisoner exchange. Would you have still done that considering your concerns about their missile program?
CLINTON: Absolutely. Look I have said for a long time that I'm very proud of the role that I played in getting us to the point where we could negotiate the agreement that puts a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program but I've also said that the way we're going to hold them accountable is to have consequences when they do anything that might deviate from the agreement or continue to block the kind of sanctions and mandates the U.N. Security Council has put on, including on missiles.
So I see these as mutually reinforcing, Chuck. I was delighted that the prisoners are on their way home. That's a good sign. We still don't see Bob Levinson coming home, there's more work to be done there. But if the implementation of the agreement which is being done today is to be successful in the way that I expect we're going to watch Iran like the proverbial hawk.
And when it comes to the missile program, they are under U.N. Security Council sanctions and if they are violating it which the evidence seems to suggest they should be held accountable. They need to know that this is a good step forward with respect to the nuclear weapons program but there are other areas of their behavior that we're going to continue to be focused on.
TODD: Do you consider Iran a national security threat to the United States?
CLINTON: Well, certainly we have lowered that threat because of the nuclear agreement but they continue to be destabilize governments in the Middle East. They continue to support proxies and terrorist groups like Hezbollah. They continue to threaten Israel. There are a lot of concerns. But what I've said for some time now is I'd rather have the nuclear weapons program off to one side and work to make sure they abide by the agreement and then turn our attention to some of these other behaviors that are threatening, certainly in the region and therefore cause concern for us.
TODD: All right. Let me move to the campaign. To try to figure out why this race has gotten closer in Iowa, why your lead has shrunk in Iowa, we spoke to a number of voters. I want to play three sound bites from Iowa voters about some potential pause they have regarding your candidacy. I'm going to play it and get you to respond on the other side.
[begin video clip]
JAY HELTON, O'MALLEY SUPPORTER: You get the impression from her that she believes maybe the rules don't apply to her. Or the same rules don't apply to her that apply to everybody else.
NATASHA NEWCOMB, SANDERS SUPPORTER: She's worked really hard and done some amazing things I just feel that Bernie Sanders is kind of—has a little bit more fire lit up in people.
SALLY WILSON, CLINTON SUPPORTER: Well, I hear people talking about questioning her honesty. And I don't necessarily do that but I think that's one thing people are kind of not sure and they've felt that way about Bill Clinton, too. So I think some of that rubs off.
[end video clip]
TODD: Madam Secretary, how do you answer that pause. This is from Democrats—some pause that they have.
CLINTON: Well, first of all, Chuck, I always thought this was going to be close and I can't speak for anybody else but I've worked as hard as I can to build an organization in Iowa, to be out there listening and talking with Iowans as they move toward making the first in the nation decision in the caucus on February 1.
And I've also been very consistent over the course of my public life. If I tell you I'm going to fight for something, I will do my very best to get results. I think that's why I have such strong support and I feel very good about where we are but we're going to just keep working until the very last caucus is decided on February 1.
TODD: You know, another problem you may be having in Iowa is that you don't ideologically fit. This was in the Des Moines Register poll this week. 43 percent of likely Democratic caucus goers identify as socialist. Only 38 percent of likely Democratic caucus goers identified themselves as a capitalist. You, in the last debate, said you were a capitalist. Bernie Sanders calls himself a Democratic socialist. If you don't win Iowa, do you think that's the reason?
CLINTON: Oh, I don't know how people take all this information. But I support a free market economy. I support the competitiveness that has created the greatest economic engine in the history of the world. What I am worried about is that it's not continuing to do what it used to do which is to give the vast majority of Americans the chance to get ahead and stay ahead.
That's why I've got a very vigorous jobs agenda. That's why I put raising incomes at the center of my economic policy and I think what I know will work is to get back the good old-fashioned job opportunities that will help people get ahead through manufacturing, through infrastructure, through clean energy, through the kinds of plans that I've been putting out.
Look, when we have a Democrat in the White House—a Democrat—we do that better economically. We saw that when my husband was president, we've watched President Obama dig us out of the huge ditch that Republican policies put us into, so I'm very confident that I know what will work if we have a—the right commitment as a nation and that's what I want to do as president.
TODD: Let me ask you about whether—going with Chicago—right now, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has been under fire for what he may have known about a shooting incident. Do you think he still has the credibility to heal the wounds in Chicago between the African-American community and law enforcement?
CLINTON: Look, like everybody else who watched that video on television I was just outraged by what happened to Laquan McDonald. I was one of the first to call for a complete Department of Justice investigation and, in fact, urged that it include the entire Chicago police department.
This is not a problem that is unique to Chicago, unfortunately, and we've got to do more to deal with the systemic racism and the problems that policing has demonstrated. Mayor Emanuel has said that he is committed to complete and total reform and I think he should be held to that standard.
TODD: But do you think he still has the credibility to do that?
CLINTON: Well, that's going to be up to him and up to the people of Chicago to prove.
TODD: Very quickly, the movie ""13 Hours"" about the incident in Benghazi. I know there's a lot of chatter about the movie itself. But let me ask you—the controversy involves whether or not everything was done that night to rescue Ambassador Stevens.
Looking back, do you believe everything was done that night that could have been done to save his life?
CLINTON: Based on everything I know and based on a Republican-led intelligence committee investigation, is a Republican-led arms services committee investigation, the answer to that is yes. That people were scrambling trying to figure out what could be done if anything.
And I can't speak to a movie but I know people have raised questions about some of the dramatization. I testified for more than 11 hours, as you know I answered every question I was asked. My real focus, Chuck, is what do we do to make sure that we send Americans into harm's way—military or civilian, diplomats or our soldiers—we take every precaution to the best of our ability in what is an unpredictable and dangerous world to make sure that they can discharge their duties and be safe while doing it.
TODD: All right. Secretary Clinton, I have to leave it there. We look forward to seeing you tonight on stage in Charleston for the Democratic debate.
CLINTON: Great.
TODD: That's right here on NBC. Thank you.
CLINTON: Thanks a lot.
TODD: You got it.

CBS ""Face the Nation"" Interview with Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Democratic Presidential Candidate
LENGTH: 1189 words
??????????????????????? Subject: The 2016 Presidential Race
Participants: John Dickerson
Time: 10:30:00
Date: 2016-01-17
DICKERSON: And we start with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is in Charleston this morning. Good morning, Secretary Clinton.
After this prisoner exchange, Senator Marco Rubio said—quote—""If you take an American hostage, Barack Obama will cut a deal with you, whether it's Bowe Bergdahl, what he did with the Castro brothers, and now what he's done with Iran.""
Your reaction to that?
CLINTON: Well, I think it's just typical political rhetoric, and it overlooks some very basic, important issues.
Number one, we always try to get Americans back who are unjustly held. I certainly did when I was secretary of state. And when I was a senator, I advocated for the Bush administration to do the same for people who have been unlawfully held in foreign countries.
Secondly, the important news here is that the Iranian agreement to put a lid on the nuclear weapons program of Iran is being implemented. The Iranians have so far fulfilled their side of the bargain by destroying centrifuges, by shipping out 98 percent or so of their enriched uranium out of their country, even making one of their plutonium reactors under construction no longer able to be ever used because they have poured cement into it.
So, the real issue here is, if you're committed to making the world safer and to show strong American leadership, you have to engage in patient, persistent diplomacy with people who are not your friends. They are on the other side of a lot of the issues and values that you hold very dear, and that is certainly true for the United States.
DICKERSON: Former FBI agent Robert Levinson is still in Iran. Do you believe that the Iranians know where he is? And, if so, why wasn't he a part of this deal?
CLINTON: Well, I regret deeply that Robert Levinson was not on his way home either. And I hope and expect that the Iranians will continue to be pressed very, very hard to give up any information they have and, if possible, to return Bob Levinson to his home and family.
DICKERSON: Switching to the topic of gun control, you have said Bernie Sanders should vote or support the idea of lifting the immunity block on gun manufacturers. He now says he will support the legislation you have pushed him to. So, hasn't he done what you wanted him to do?
CLINTON: Well, I am pleased that Senator Sanders has flip-flopped on legal immunity for gun makers and sellers. Now I hope he will also join members of Congress to change what's called the Charleston loophole that enabled the killer in Charleston to get the gun that he used to murder nine people at Bible study here in Mother Emanuel Church. That's something else Senator Sanders has supported that we need to change.
So, now I'm calling on him to also flip-flop in the right direction and sign on the legislation to change the Charleston loophole.
DICKERSON: You at once in 1939 when you were first lady supported in testimony in front of the Senate Finance Committee a 25 percent tax on guns. You're not supporting that now or promoting that now.
How have you evolved over the years in terms of your support for the Second Amendment?
CLINTON: Well, I do support the Second Amendment. That has always been understood.
I just believe that, like any amendment to our Constitution, there are reasonable steps that can be taken. We have reasonable restrictions on certain kind of speech or certain forms of assembly. And for goodness sakes, we ought to be smart enough and do so consistent with the Constitution, to have more gun safety measures to try to save some of the 33,000 lives that we lose to gun violence every single year.
This is something that I have spoken out about, that I have advocated for right now. I think there is a consensus in the country on comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online and Charleston loopholes, reversing the immunity given to the gun industry, certainly prohibiting would-be terrorists on the no-fly zone from buying guns.
That's kind of the commonsense approach that we should be working to achieve.
DICKERSON: I would like to ask you about these stories out of Flint, Michigan. Lead levels in the water have created an emergency there. Senator Sanders called for Rick Snyder, the governor, to resign. What is your feeling?
CLINTON: Well, John, this is an issue I have been involved in now for a couple of weeks. I am horrified by what has happened in Flint.
I started calling for immediate action, calling for federal intervention. I sent two of my top campaign aides to meet with the mayor of Flint. As you may know, I appeared on a show this past week and demanded that Governor Snyder ask for the help that Michigan needs to deal with the horrible consequences that children and their families are facing in Flint.
And I saw that Governor Snyder turned around within two hours and finally asked for the help that he should have asked for some weeks ago. I don't want to get caught up in the political back and forth here. I want to help the people of Flint.
And I particularly want a comprehensive health analysis of what's happened to these children. Lead is a poison. It destroys your brain. It interferes with your learning and your behavior. Whatever it takes for Michigan and the federal government to come together, through FEMA, through Health and Human Services, the EPA, whatever it takes, we now have to fix the problem and help these kids and especially their health and education development probably for years to come.
DICKERSON: On the topic of health care back at the national level, you—your daughter, Chelsea Clinton, said that Senator Sanders' universal health care plan will dismantle Obamacare, dismantle Children's Health Insurance Program, and a series of other things it would dismantle.
Aren't—isn't she and your campaign not taking into account that those things would be replaced by an actual plan that Senator Sanders has put forward?
CLINTON: Well, I think it's very confusing, because he hasn't put forward a plan.
And the only way we know what it is he's advocating for comes from looking at the nine bills that he's introduced in the House and Senate and Congress. And in those bills, every kind of health care is rolled all up together, and handed over to the states, which bear a financial responsibility to match what the federal government provides in order to administer health care.
So, it's not a traditional kind of single-payer system, as I understand it. It is a state-based system, kind of similar to Medicaid, if you will. And I do think there are very legitimate questions that can be raised, and because we don't have an up-to-date plan from Senator Sanders, all of us trying to figure out what it would mean for everybody to be put into that new system.
DICKERSON: All right.
Well, Senator—excuse me—Secretary Clinton, I know that will be debated this evening when you're on the stage with Senator Sanders.
We thank you for being with us.
CLINTON: Great to talk to you again, John.

Madam Secretary, thanks so much for joining us.
On Saturday, you called for new sanctions against Iran for its ballistic missile program. That prompted a response from another American who was once held prisoner in Iran, Shane Bauer, one of the hikers released in 2011. He had some tough words for you on Twitter, writing—quote—""Seriously, why would Hillary call for more sanctions now? As far as we know, four of the Americans are still in Iran. Totally irresponsible""—unquote.
He also said, whenever he was in Iran, whenever he heard your voice, his heart would sink, because—quote—""All she ever does with Iran is inflame tensions.""
I want to give you awe chance to respond.
CLINTON: Well, look, I appreciate what he went through when he was held prisoner in the infamous Iranian prison.
And we were very happy that we were able to get him and the two other hikers back home. But we have a very clear path we are pursuing with Iran. I am pleased that we do have an agreement that is being implemented. And I was part of putting that in place by getting the sanctions imposed on Iran that the entire world went along with.
But we also have made it clear from the beginning that their missile activity is still subject to sanction. That is part of the overall approach that the administration has taken toward Iran, and that I support.
So, when we became aware of missile activity that is under U.N. supervision and is prohibited, it would be a mistake not to make clear to Iran that we are very, very happy to see us implementing the agreement to put a lid on the nuclear weapons program and the way that they have complied, but that doesn't mean they can now go off and invest and test a lot of missiles that would eventually be able to be intercontinental that could reach the United States and maybe carry a very dangerous weapon.
So, I think there might be a misunderstanding of what our whole agreement consists of, because, certainly, I have made clear I'm proud of the role that I played in getting that agreement in place, but, as president, I will enforce it.
And there have to be consequences if Iran veers away from what it has agreed to or what it has been mandated to do or prohibited from doing by the international community.
TAPPER: Let's turn to politics, obviously a big night tonight, a Democratic debate.
You will be facing off with Bernie Sanders in this new, more contentious phase of the election, with just a week and a—two weeks and a day until the Iowa caucuses.
One of your top allies, David Brock, is calling on Bernie Sanders to release his medical records. The Sanders campaign—campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, he called this—quote—""one of the most desperate and vile attacks imaginable.""
Who's right there, David Brock or Jeff Weaver? [laughter]
CLINTON: Well, I don't know anything about it, but I have released my medical records.
And I remember being asked frequently for me to do so. And, so, obviously that's, you know, something I will leave up to the Sanders campaign.
But this is a spirited debate, because, although we share some very similar goals for our country, we have differences. And Senator Sanders has been pointing them out.
One of my biggest differences has been on guns. And I'm very pleased that he flip-flopped on the immunity legislation. Now I hope he will flip-flop on what we call the Charleston loophole, and join legislation to close that, because it's been a key argument of my campaign that we Democrats, in fact, Americans need to stand up to the gun lobby and pass comprehensive commonsense gun measures that will make America safer. And that's what I intend to do.
TAPPER: One of your major lines of attack against Bernie Sanders, in addition to the gun one that you just leveled, has been on his proposal for single-payer health care.
Back in 1994, you said a single-payer system administrated by the states would actually lower health care costs. Take a listen.
[begin video clip from 1994]
CLINTON (in 1994): Single-payer would have lower costs. And one of the reasons that the president has a provision in his approach that guarantees states can go single-payer is to permit states that are able to do that to start down the single-payer road.
[end video clip]
TAPPER: Now, I know that was a long time ago, but you said in the Q&A single-payer would not be politically feasible.
In a perfect world, do you believe that single-payer would ultimately lower health care costs?
CLINTON: Well, I believe in universal health care. And I think we have now, finally, after many decades of efforts, thanks to President Obama, a plan that will get us to universal health care. It's the Affordable Care Act. So, I'm not interested in what the Republicans are trying to do, which is to repeal it, as they consistently vote to do. And I also think it would be a mistake to really thrust our country into another contentious national debate about how we're going to provide quality, affordable health care to everybody. So, I'm...
TAPPER: Right, but just on the merits.
CLINTON: ... very focused on—well, the merits are we need to get to universal health care. That is the merit.
The merit is, how do we get to universal health care, where everybody's covered, where everybody can afford it? We have had some experimentation with states. Actually, Vermont tried to do single-payer. They found that the cost and the taxes that were required were prohibitive.
Colorado now has a referendum on its ballot, so it's going to also pursue it. I'm a big believer in letting states experiment. But when it comes to where we are right now, in 2016, I'm going to defend, protect, and improve the Affordable Care Act.
TAPPER: For years, you have been very protective of your daughter, Chelsea Clinton, especially when she was a child, of course, and now she's a grown woman.
This week, she surprised a lot of people when she unleashed one of the most scathing attacks of the cycle, accusing Bernie Sanders of wanting to empower Republican governors who might then cut people's health care.
PolitiFact called Chelsea's remarks mostly false. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said it was not an honest attack. And liberal columnist Mark Shields said the attack turned your daughter into a—quote—""political hack.""
Do you think it was a mistake to muddy up Chelsea like that?
CLINTON: Look, she was asked a question. I love my daughter. And she answered a question.
And all I can say, Jake, is that the only health plan we know of from Senator Sanders is what's described in the legislation that he has introduced nine times in the Congress, in the Senate. And it does turn all of the programs we know of that provide health care over to the states.
The federal government would provide a big portion of the cost, but states would be mandated to also pay considerably, about 14 percent of the cost. That's what's in his bill.
So, I think anyone who wants to compare and contrast, since we don't have any more current plan from Senator Sanders, has to look at the legislation that he introduced.
And, yes, if it were going to be state-run, then governors, Republican and Democrat alike, would bear responsibility for appropriating the funds and administrating it, according to Senator Sanders' own legislative proposals.
TAPPER: So, no regrets about using Chelsea that way?
CLINTON: Oh, I didn't use her. She answered a question.
And, you know, she gave a factual answer, based on the legislation that is the only way we know what Senator Sanders is actually proposing, because he introduced it nine times in the Congress.
TAPPER: OK. PolitiFact said it was mostly false, but let's move on.
A new movie opened this weekend. It's called ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi."" It's a cinematic version of a book, a nonfiction book, telling the story of the six private security contractors who defended the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, from an attack by Islamic militants.
Are you planning to see it at all?
CLINTON: I'm just too busy campaigning. I am still very focused on making sure we do everything we can, as I did when I was secretary of state, as I testified to over 11 hours, to make sure that nothing like that happens again, insofar as we are able to prevent it.
And that's my focus when it comes to the continuing obligation that the United States government has whenever we send anyone into harm's way.
TAPPER: Let's talk about ISIS. It's a big concern among many Americans.
I know that you're very reluctant to criticize President Obama, and I understand that. But I want to ask you about the situation in Syria on the ground, because Anne-Marie Slaughter, who is the former director of policy planning at the State Department under you, she told me on my show ""THE LEAD that, if President Obama had listened to you about arming the Syrian moderates years ago, there's a—quote—""very good chance that we would not be facing ISIS like we are now.""
Do you agree?
CLINTON: Well, we will never know the answer to that question.
Obviously, I thought, at the time, it was the right approach. And I advocated for it, along with then Secretary Panetta and CIA Director Petraeus, because I was worried about what would happen if there were a very vicious civil war, when, on one side, you had Assad's army backed by Iran, and now we know also backed by Russia, against a group of people who wanted more freedom, wanted to live in dignity, not the continuing oppression from the Assad regime, that it would be a pretty uneven match, to be understating that, and it could open territory for terrorist groups, foreign fighters, and others to come in.
So, let's talk about where we are now. And I have laid out a plan to deal with ISIS about airpower that is being used now, with more nations joining the United States, which is in the lead, to try to go after ISIS leadership, infrastructure, other assets, also to support Iraqi and Syrian fighters who are on the ground trying to take territory back from ISIS, and what else we need to do to build up those forces, the Iraqi army, which has had some success taking back Ramadi, Sunni tribal fighters, which we have to get back into the fight, and that is beginning to happen, and supporting the Kurdish fighters, who have been extraordinary brave on both sides of the border, by helping to equip and support them.
So, we have a clear mission to deprive ISIS of territory. And there is some movement, positive movement on that. And then we have to cut off their foreign fighters, their foreign funding, and take them online—take them on online, so that they are no longer able to recruit and propagandize, which keeps their flow of fighters and money coming.
TAPPER: I'm told we're out of time. I just have one last question for you.
In terms of the status of the FBI investigation into your private e-mail server, have you been interviewed by the FBI yet?
CLINTON: No.
TAPPER: You haven't.
All right, Secretary Clinton, thanks so much. Really appreciate your time. Good luck with the debate tonight.
CLINTON: Thanks. Thanks, Jake.

31,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5000,"January 24, 2016","Interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News ""Meet the Press""",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111436,Hillary Clinton,"TODD: This morning, there is some good news though for Clinton. She won the endorsement of the ""Des Moines Register"". By the way, as did Marco Rubio on the Republican side but one would argue the ""Des Moines Register"" will probably have a greater impact among Democratic caucus goers.
So joining me from Cedar Rapids, Iowa is the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Madam Secretary—welcome back.
CLINTON: Thank you—Chuck. It's good to talk to you this morning.
TODD: You got it.
Let me just start with this. Your opponent 74 years old, calls himself a socialist, started this campaign with next to zero name recognition. You have 38 of 44 U.S. senators endorsing, 12 of 18 Democratic governors. He has zero.
What happened? What's gone wrong? Save me the ""we always knew this was going to be a close race"" answer.
CLINTON: Well Chuck—look, I think it's actually good for the debate that we're having that there is so much interest and energy that I feel on my side and I know, obviously so does senator Sanders on his.
We have a big choice to make. And it's exciting. I had a great couple of events yesterday. I'm enthusiastically pursuing the opportunity to reach every single voter in Iowa and we're going to see what happens. I feel good about where we are. Obviously, we'll find out a week from tomorrow.
But if you look at the differences between Senator Sanders and myself, I just don't think we can't wait. We can't wait to make progress on the myriad of issues that I think we're going to be facing in the next administration. I want to build on the progress that President Obama has made and he has a different approach. And that's what voters are trying to determine, which they prefer.
TODD: Look, as you know, the caucuses sometimes are about passion, enthusiasm. Let me read you something that was in the ""New York Times"" from Gayle Collins. ""Nevertheless, you can't ignore the fact that Hillary Clinton is now the candidate of the aging Democratic establishment whose supporters pray for a low turnout on the Election Day. That might get her nominated in the long run but it's not really the kind of image that makes you go whistling into the election booth.""
By the way, she wrote that in 2008. By the way, she wrote that in 2008, Madam Secretary. Is there a deja vu happening here?
CLINTON: No, there isn't. I just have to tell you, can only react to what I'm doing, feeling, getting responses from people. And you know, I feel great that we have the level of enthusiasm that we do and we also have a really good team on the ground that has been working for months to make sure that it's not just here today, gone tomorrow. But people are involved. They are really reached out to and yes, we believe they're going to come caucus. So, you know, the speculation and all the rest of it is entertaining, I admit that. But we're just going to keep moving forward and do the work that we think is going to be successful on February 1st.
TODD: Are you worried that experience, your long resume, is not an asset in this wild year?
CLINTON: No, I'm really not. Because I think at the end of the day people take this vote seriously. They know they're voting for who they prefer to be the next president and commander in chief, and I believe that when I am out there talking with people about what we have to go up against here at home, get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top, begin to raise incomes, which hasn't happened, deal with health care, going from 90 percent coverage, which is what we have under the Affordable Care Act now, to 100 percent and I lay out what intend to do to get there.
I can only tell you they see people nodding. I know people are signing up as they leave my events. That's what matters here. It's very personal, and people look and they think, can we imagine this person to be president and commander in chief? And because of my experience, particularly my years as secretary of state working with President Obama, I think that's something that people really take into account.
TODD: What are you willing to—you know, it's interesting, your husband used a lot of political capital—you and your husband used a lot of political capital to do health care. President Obama, arguably, used all of his political capital to get health care passed.
What is it? What is the one issue you are going to be willing to use all your political capital to focus on? You and I both know you basically have one big shot at one big issue. What is it that you're willing to use all your political capital to do with?
CLINTON: Well, Chuck, first of all, I don't agree with you on that. I think that there are several really important issues, health care being one of them. We've got to get costs down. I met a man on Friday who no longer can afford to pay for his HIV medication. I met a woman yesterday whose bill for the drugs she must take and has taken for 25 years has gone from a couple hundred to over $14,000 for the same amount of the drug.
That really hits my heart. I know what people are going through. I'm going to use whatever tools I can to get us lower prices, cap those prescription drug companies and take that on.
But I'm also going to focus on the economy because unless we create more jobs and get incomes rising and fix the tax system so that it doesn't in so many ways tilt toward the wealthy, people are not going to get ahead, they're not going to feel they're getting ahead and they're going to still believe that the government, the economy is rigged against them which is bad for our democracy. TODD: As you know, your opponent Senator Sanders has been hitting you on Wall Street contributions and including some paid speeches that you did for Goldman Sachs among other banks. Let me ask you this—why do you think one of these big banks paid you over $200,000 for a speech?
CLINTON: Well, look, I gave speeches to a wide array of groups from health care groups to auto dealers and many, many more, and I think what they were interested in because what we talked about was the world coming off of four years as secretary of state in a complicated world, people were interested in what I saw, what I thought, they asked questions about matters that were on their minds. A lot of interest in the bin laden raid, how such a tough decision was made and what I advised the President. You know, I think Americans who are doing business in every aspect of the economy want to know more about the world. I actually think it's a good conversation for people to be having.
TODD: You don't think they expect anything in return?
CLINTON: Absolutely not. You know, first of all, I was a senator from New York. I took them on when I was senator. I took on the carried interest loophole. I took on what was happening in the mortgage markets. I was talking about that in 2006. They know exactly where I stand.
And I'll tell you, Chuck, it's really interesting to me that now Karl Rove has taken money from the financial interest to run an ad against me to try to influence Democrats not to support me. Why? Ask yourself why.
Because he knows number one I know what must be done, and number two I know how to get it done to make sure that Wall Street writ large, not just the banks but the investment banks, the hedge funds and everybody else, no longer can wreck our economy the way they did in 2008.
TODD: All right. Two more quick questions.
The ""Des Moines Register"" editorial, in praising you and your experience, did bring up the e-mail issue as one of those things that they're frustrated with how you responded to it.
Let me just ask you this question. Last week you were asked about the FBI investigation. Are you concerned? You said you haven't been contacted by them. Are you concerned this investigation is taking too long? That it's putting an extra cloud over your candidacy and until it gets behind you, you're sort of going to have these issues and Michael Bloomberg even cited it as a reason why he's thinking about running.
CLINTON: No, I'm not concerned because I know what the facts are. I never sent or received any material marked classified. I cannot control what the Republicans leak and what they are contending. And I said it was interesting, Chuck—you'll as a political observer understand why. You know, back a couple of months ago Kevin McCarthy spilled the beans that the Benghazi investigation was all about bringing me down, something that I suspected but I went ahead, testified for 11 hours, answered all their questions, and even they admitted there was nothing new.
And now Senator Grassley shows up at a Trump rally yesterday in Iowa. He's the chairman of the judiciary committee who has—and his staff have been behind and pushing a lot of these stories, and announces he's there for the simple reason, to defeat me.
I can't control what the Republicans are doing. But I know what the facts are and I will just keep putting them out there. This is something that I think is very clear about what happened and I know it will be over and resolved at some point. But I can't control what the Republicans and their allies do. But I think it's important voters know what they're doing.
TODD: And Michael Bloomberg? Your reaction to his potential candidacy?
CLINTON: He's a good friend of mine, and I'm going to do the best I can to make sure that I get the nomination, and we'll go from there.
TODD: So you're not worried about him getting in?
CLINTON: Well, the way I read what he said is if I didn't get the nomination he might consider it. Well, I'm going to relieve him of that and get the nomination so he doesn't have to.
TODD: All right. Madam Secretary—stay safe on the trail. We'll catch up with you soon.
CLINTON: Thank you. Good to talk to you.
TODD: Nice to talk with you.

32,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5000,"January 26, 2016","Remarks at a Campaign Rally in Marshalltown, Iowa",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111414,Hillary Clinton,"CLINTON: Oh, thank you all so much. Thank you. Oh, you are great. Thank you.
Oh, my goodness. I'll tell you, it was worth it, trying to get here. You have been so generous with your time. And I'm just so grateful to be back in Marshalltown and to have this chance to talk with you, now less than a week until the caucus on Monday night. But it's just really meaningful to me that you would be here and be part of this process, and I really am grateful to each and every one of you.
I've learned a lot in the last months, and I really think that spending all this time in small groups and big ones is going to make me a better president. So I thank you for everything you've done to make that possible. [applause]
And I really want to thank Mark Smith for his endorsement. I'm thrilled. Thank you so very much, Representative. And I have a—I have a plan that I hope will come to pass when it—that affects Mark. And that is I hope that we will be able to make him the majority leader of the House of Representatives in the state legislature. [applause]
Think of all the good things that he could do for you and for people across Iowa.
Well, it's getting close. And when all of you decide to go caucus on Monday, you're going to be the first people in the world to get to express an opinion about who should be the next president and commander in chief for our country.
And I know how seriously Iowans take this because I've been talking with you and listening to you. But I want to just spend a few minutes really discussing what's at stake, because this is one of the most consequential elections that we've had in quite some time.
When you think about it, there are some very big differences between us and the Republicans, and that puts a special responsibility on you and voters to try to decide where you stand. Well, I will tell you where I stand.
I believe that the Republican policies that are being promoted by this crop of candidates that are traveling across our state and country would set our country back, rip up the progress we've made, and undermine our future. And that is true across the board, but let me just pick a few of the most important issues. Let's take the economy.
You heard from them, they are spouting the same failed economic policies: trickle-down economics; cut taxes on the wealthy; get out of the way of corporations. We have tried that, it does not work. And it's important to know the facts. And the facts are that our economy does better when we have a Democrat in the White House who cares about creating jobs and raising incomes for Americans. [applause]
And the last two Democratic presidents we've had, both of whom I know, which I kind of am proud of, they each inherited economic problems from their Republican predecessors.
You know, in my husband's case, it was a recession, a huge national debt that had been quadrupled in the prior 12 years and a big deficit. So when he got to Washington, people said, ""OK. So, what do you especially bring to Washington that can make a difference?"" He said, ""Well, I guess I bring arithmetic. We're going to make it add up again for the American people."" And at the end of eight years, we did.
Twenty-three million new jobs, but most importantly, incomes went up for everybody. Not just those at the top, hard-working middle-class families, working families, poor families. More people were lifted out of poverty than in any recent time in our history. And we ended up with a balanced budget and a surplus. We were on the right track.
Well, back came the Republicans and back came trickle-down economics. George W. Bush slashed taxes on the wealthy and got out of the way of corporations to the extent that the man he put in charge of keeping an eye on Wall Street took a chainsaw to a big stack of regulations and had a great big smile on his face.
Now we know what happened, don't we? We went into the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression, and when Barack Obama became president, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month. I don't think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for digging us out of that big ditch that the Republicans put us in during their administration. [applause]
And it was not easy. I know; I talked to him about it. When he asked me to be secretary of State, he said, ""We got to focus on the economy here at home and we got to fix all the problems that we also inherited around the world.""
And what did he do? Well, we're back on track with 14 million new jobs. The Affordable Care Act was passed. We're now at 90 percent health care coverage in America for the first time. [applause]
He passed and signed the toughest regulations on Wall Street since the 1930s, the Dodd-Frank law; saved the auto industry, which was on the brink of collapse which would have taken another, you know, couple of million jobs down with them. We ended up losing 9 million because of that Great Recession, 5 million homes were lost and $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.
Now, if you want to go back there, you got a lot of folks, including one who was here today, who are spouting that same stuff, because that's where we'll end up again. In fact, you are four times more likely to see a recession in America when you have a Republican in the White House.
So the economy is going to be at the core of this election. So you should ask everybody who's running what they're going to do about it. And I got to tell you, I'm proud of what we've been doing on the Democratic side. We have our differences, but we have differences over issues, and that's what we talk about, not insults, which is what happens among the Republicans.
So I've put out a plan. Here is what I think we need to do. We need more infrastructure jobs. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our rail systems, our sewer systems, our water systems. We have work to do in our country, and those are jobs that can't be exported, they need to be done right here and put Americans back to work building our economy, making us more competitive.
And then we're going to take the tax system and get rid of the incentives that actually encourage people to take jobs and move them overseas, take factories and build them overseas. We're going to reverse that so we start investing in America again, advance manufacturing. I know it can be done because I've been to some of your community colleges. I have seen the work that is happening there, the training that is going on.
I also know it can be done because while we are going to combat climate change, we're going to create more clean, renewable energy jobs. And that will be a huge economic opportunity—[applause]—that is directly linked to what Iowa has been doing.
You know, the Republicans, when you ask them about climate change, they all say the same thing. ""Well, I don't know, I'm not a scientist."" You know, there's an easy way to remedy that. Go talk to a scientist, listen to a scientist, learn about what's going on. And, you know, that's bad enough that they're into denial. What really is troubling is they're missing this huge economic opportunity.
And when I tell people that, I see, you know, sometimes folks around the country have a little bit of skepticism on their faces, and here's what I tell them. I know we can create those jobs because look at what Iowa has done.
And I want you to thank Representative Smith. Thank you. And it started with Tom Vilsack and the Democrats making a commitment. Iowa now gets one-third of your electricity from renewable sources, mostly wind.
You have 7,000 people already working in the wind industry in this state. You are doing research on advanced biofuels that the Defense Department thinks may be able to fuel Navy vessels and Air Force planes. So Iowa is in the forefront of the energy revolution because some country is going to be the 21st century clean energy superpower. It's either going to be China, Germany, or us. I want it to be us, and we need to make up our minds that it is going to be us and we're going to be doing the technology, the innovation and exporting to the rest of the world. [applause]
We also need to be focusing on small business because that's where most of the jobs come from in America. And I want to be the small business president. My dad was a small businessman, so I want to clear away all the underbrush so people can start businesses again. And especially young people. S lot of young people tell me they'd love to go into business, but they can't get credit. Part of it is they have such student debts they can't get credit; we've got to fix that. So we need to make it easier to start and grow a small business.
Now, there are two ways we can raise incomes real quick. One, we've got to raise the minimum wage. People who work full time should not still be in poverty. [applause]
There should be a ladder of opportunity. And the other way is to guarantee equal pay for women's work, and that will raise incomes and families will be better off, the economy will be. [applause]
Now, everything I've just said to you the Republicans don't agree with it, every bit of it. They don't believe in any of it. They don't really tell you what they will do except just, you know, get out of the way and let corporations do whatever they want and let their, you know, big donors do whatever they want. Well, that's not going to work. We know it won't, and we can't be sold that bill of goods again.
The other thing we have to do is to change the tax system so that it is fairer. And I'm am the only candidate running on either side who has made this pledge. I will raise your incomes, I will not raise middle-class taxes. I do not think it is right—[applause]—to be going to people who suffered because of the Republican recession and asking for you to help us make the investments for the future. I want you to take advantage of them, but I want to go where the money is, and the money is at the top, and that's where we need to be shifting our tax system. So we need to close the loopholes and the special gimmicks that corporations and the wealthy use, like this thing called the ""carried interest loophole"" that I've been against for years.
We also need to do what Warren Buffett suggested. I was really very happy that he endorsed me, and I went to Omaha with him. And we were standing there and he—[applause]—he said, you know, I'm not too popular among my rich friends these days because I think people like me should pay more money into our tax system to support our country. And he has something he calls the Buffett rule. Anybody who makes $1 million should have to pay a 30 percent effective tax rate. So I've adopted the Buffett rule and we're going to go right at it and try to get that done. [applause]
And then I want to go further, I want to impose what I call a fair share surcharge on incomes of $5 million or more. Now, there aren't very many of those, but there's a lot of money there because I want to use that money to make college affordable. I want to use that money to invest in clean energy. I want to use that money to move toward paid family leave so that families get more support to be able to do their work at home and take care of their families. I want to use that money to help bring down the cost of child care, which in some states is as expensive as college tuition. There are things we can do that will relieve the burdens on middle-class families, and the money should come from those who have it.
Now, people say to me, ""Well, how are we ever going to get that done?"" Well, I do have a political strategy. I've seen a little bit of this in the last 20-plus years. There are not that many people who make $5 million or more in America, and I think we can make a very clear case.
Mr. Congressman over there, are you in favor of clean energy and affordable college? Are you in favor of early childhood education and the way we're going to get it is to tax the two people in your district who make more than $5 million? Or are you going to deny that to the 350,000 people who live in your district?
We're going to make a very tough case about why we have to make the tax code fairer. You know, you can talk about it, but I have a plan to do it. Not just a plan on the substance, but a political plan because I want you to know what I aim to do for you and what it will cost you. And I want everybody to be able to look at that and make your own judgment.
I also have what has been described as the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan to go after Wall Street.
Now, I totally agree with my two esteemed opponents, Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley, that we've got to keep our eyes on the big banks. And no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail. But we already have the authority to go after them. That was in the Dodd-Frank bill. We don't have to do that, we just have to implement it. And I have said if they pose a systemic risk to our economy, I will go after them and I will use the process President Obama signed into law.
But here's where I differ with my two friends—that is not enough. And this is what we've been arguing about on the debate stage. You see it wasn't just the big banks that caused our problems, it was an investment bank like Lehman Brothers. It was a big insurance conglomerate called AIG. It was a mortgage company called Countrywide. It was another bank, not one of the big five, called Wachovia, and others who are in what is called the shadow banking sector.
So what I've is we're going after risk wherever it is in the financial system. And Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, said I have the best plan. Barney Frank, who is actually the Frank in Dodd-Frank, said I have the best plan because I'm trying to look not just at what happened in the past to prevent that from happening again, but what could happen in the future.
And you know, the best evidence I have that I have the best plan is that the Republicans and their billionaire allies are running ads against me. You know, it started a few weeks ago. These two hedge fund billionaires formed a super PAC to run ads against me to convince Democrats not to support me. And then along came Karl Rove, you know, the errand boy for the billionaires, and he's now running an ad against me. And now another billionaire has jumped in, and he's now running an ad against me.
Now you got to stop to think, why are they spending all this money to try to convince Democrats not to support me? Well, I think you know the answer, because they know that I say what I mean, I do what I say I will do, and I know how to get it done, to take after them, to prevent them from—[applause]—pushing an agenda on us that hurts the economy.
Now, another area where I have very strong feelings and share exactly the same goal as Senator Sanders is health care. You know, I believe in universal health care coverage. Every American should have it. You know, before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare back in '93 and '94 when I was trying to get universal health care, and we were not successful. And that was really disappointing.
I mean, the drug companies, the insurance companies spent millions of dollars against us. So we didn't succeed. And then I got to thinking, well, what can I do now? Because, you know, my view is when you're knocked down, you share the human experience because everybody gets knocked down about something. The real question is whether you get back up. So I started thinking, what can I do that can help somebody make a difference in their lives.
And I remembered when I was traveling around the country trying to get universal health care, meeting so many people who did not have health insurance, they couldn't afford it, they had a pre-existing condition and the insurance companies wouldn't give it to them. And I met so many really good, decent people who are so overwhelmed by what was happening to them. And I remember I was at the Children's Hospital in Cleveland. I was meeting with a group of parents whose kids were really sick with chronic diseases. And one man said to me, he said, ""You know, I've gone everywhere to try to get insurance for my daughters. I have two girls with cystic fibrosis, and nobody will sell it to me.""
I said what do they say when you go ask them and you tell them you want to try to pay for something? They say no. He said, I'll tell you what the last person told me at the insurance company I visited. He said, we don't insure burning houses. This man said, they called my little girls burning houses. And that stuck with me, that and the stories I heard. So I started to work with Democrats and Republicans and we created the Children's Health Insurance Program, and it now insures eight million kids because when you get—[applause]—you encounter an obstacle, you run into a problem, you've got to keep going. You can't ever stop if you're trying to accomplish something that will help other people. And I was thrilled when the president passed and signed the Affordable Care Act.
We've been trying to get that—the Democratic party has been trying to get that accomplished since Harry Truman. And now, I meet people all the time who are benefiting from it. I want to build on it and I want to improve it. You know, the Republicans want to repeal it, and that's what they'll do if they get the White House back. We can't let that happen.
Here is what I want to do. I want to decrease costs, out-of-pocket costs; decrease prescription drug costs. [applause]
I want to make sure that we get the authority for Medicare to negotiate for lower drug costs with the drug companies. I want to go after the predatory pricing that drug companies are using to raise the price of drugs. I want to take away their tax benefits. They actually get a tax benefit for advertising all that stuff on TV to us that we never—I can't understand what they're talking about.
They have people walking through fields of wildflowers, walking on beaches. They have the name of the drug which, you know, is unpronounceable. And then in a low voice, under the music, they have somebody saying if you take this drug, you know, your nose will fall off. I mean, it—[laughter]—drives you crazy. And they spend more money advertising on TV than they spend on research. So we're going to go right at them. We're going to take them on on this.
But I don't want to start over, my friends. That's the disagreement I have with Senator Sanders. I want us to build on what we have and make it better, and go from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent of Americans. I don't want to start at zero and have to—[applause]—fight it all over again, have to have the national battle we that we had on health care over the last 25 years. So I'm determined that we're going to make this work for everybody, and I know it's the right thing to do. And I hope that, you know, we will be able to get your costs down, your co-pays, your deductibles, what, you know, a lot of people are telling me are starting to pinch again.
I also will defend Social Security against privatization. The Republicans still want to privatize it. They're still talking about that. It's a terrible idea. And you know the worst part of the idea is they want to turn the entire Social Security trust fund over to Wall Street. That's what this is all about. Take all that money that people have been paying in for, you know, 75, 80 years and turn it over to Wall Street. I will never let that happen. That is the worst—[applause]—idea that is imaginable.
I will also not let them voucherize Medicare, something else they want to do, and I will not let them privatize the VA. We have to fix the VA, but we are not going to take away guaranteed benefits from our veterans who have earned them through their service. That's not going to happen. [applause]
And when it comes to foreign policy and national security, well, I think we have a lot to do to keep our country safe, and I have some ideas that I've been putting out based on what I did in the Senate after 9/11, based on my work as secretary of State.
It's imperative that we do everything we can to defeat ISIS, to stop the flow of foreign fighters and funding to fight them on the Internet where they're quite effective without putting American troops back on the ground in either Syria or Iraq. [applause]
That will not happen. It's not—it's not going to happen on my watch. And then we have to do a better job working with federal, state, and local law enforcement to keep us safe at home, and we have to do a better job sharing intelligence, getting intelligence that will help us prevent attacks.
When I was a senator after 9/11, I'd be kept up-to-date on all the threats that still were facing New York, and we had a very, very dedicated group of police and federal law enforcement and everyone who worked together. But, you know, one of the best things we did was a campaign which said, If you see something suspicious or you hear something suspicious, report it. And so people were picking up the phone and telling the police or maybe calling the FBI, and it really provided kind of the—the eyes-on help that we needed. And people could then follow up, and we prevented attacks. We foiled attacks.
Well, the reason I mention that is because of this. The Republican candidates, led by their frontrunner, have been attacking Muslims, right? You've heard that, attacking American Muslims, attacking Muslims around the world. That's not only shameful, it's dangerous. We need everybody in this country to be on the same team when it comes to preventing terrorist attacks. [applause]
And we need people who are in the community who hear something, see something to report it and not feel like they're being demonized, defamed, insulted, pushed out. And certainly, if we're going to defeat ISIS, we need a coalition that includes Muslim nations.
Now, I can tell you I built the coalition that imposed sanctions on Iran. I know a little bit about how you do this. You don't start by insulting people's religion and then ask them to be part of your effort to defeat a common adversary. [applause]
That's not the way it works in the real world. So we have to be smart about how we protect ourselves, and that will be my highest priority.
I also want to continue to move toward comprehensive immigration reform, which I think is in the best interest of our country and our economy. [applause]
And I want to let you know where I stand on a lot of the issues that the Republicans have taken positions on because they seem to be against so many of the fundamental rights that I support.
I am for a woman's right—a woman's right to make her own health decisions, and I am against defunding Planned Parenthood. [applause]
I am for marriage equality and against discrimination against the LGBT community. I am against Citizens United, which is a terrible decision that has opened the doors to floods of unaccountable money from the Koch Brothers and others. And I would do everything I can to reverse that decision.
I also want to keep pushing for criminal justice reform and reform in the incarceration system. And I want to fight for common sense gun safety measures that will help keep— [applause] —Americans safe without infringing on gun owners' rights.
We are a smart—we are a smart people. We can do this. And what I don't understand is how when we know we have, on average, 90 people a day dying from gun violence, 33,000 people a year, we cannot figure out how to protect people, protect first-graders going to school, people going to a movie theater, churchgoers going to Bible study. We can do this. We can't stop every murder or every suicide or every tragic, avoidable accident, but we can stop a lot of them without infringing on anybody's rights.
And 92 percent of the American people agree with that, and 85 percent of gun owners agree with that. So we need somebody who will stand up to the gun lobby and stop them from intimidating common sense reforms in our country. [applause]
So we have a lot of work to do, my friends. And you have been really patient. The children who are still here have been especially patient, and I don't want to keep you any longer.
I just want to say a few closing comments, and then for those of you who want to stay, I will shake your hands and take pictures and you can ask me questions. But everybody else can go home and not feel bad about it because I need you to get up tomorrow and help work to get more people to go to the caucus next Monday. [applause]
And, you know, I am all about—I am all about making progress against the odds. I am all about working with people. I worked with Republicans as first lady, as senator, as secretary of State. I worked to get results for the people I represented in the Senate as well as our country. I worked when I was secretary of State to make our country safe and to have our values and interests promoted. And I know how to find common ground because I've done it.
I don't think that—I think I—I do believe that probably every Republican I served with at one time or another sponsored a piece of my legislation. Actually, when I'm not running for something, they say nice things about me. [laughter]
Even in the case of Mr. Trump, they give me money because they think I'm so good as a candidate and a senator. So, you know, this is politics. This is all that that goes on.
But once the election is over, I will work as hard as I can to find that common ground, to get good things to happen for you, for your families, for your country and make it possible for young people to feel like I felt, that, you know, really the American Dream was available. You had to work for it, but if you did, you could get ahead and stay ahead. That's what I think about when it comes to my granddaughter. You know, I am the granddaughter of a factory worker, she is the granddaughter of a former president. I think it shouldn't matter. The grandchildren of everybody should have the same opportunities in our country. [applause]
And that's what I am going to stand up for and fight for. And with your help, starting at the caucus next Monday night, that's what we will do together. Thank you all so much. [applause]

Donald Trump is not going to debate on Fox tomorrow night. Will you debate on our debate? Will you show up?
CLINTON [via telephone]: Look, Chris, what I've said through my campaign is that I would look forward to another debate. I am, you know, anxious, if we can get something set up, to be able to be there. And so let's try to make it happen.
MATTHEWS: Well, someone has to lead from the front. Will you be there, no matter what? Will you show up and wait and see? Will you be there waiting for Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley? Would you, in other words, lead the pack in showing up and committing to doing that?
CLINTON: Look, I'm ready for the debate, and I hope Senator Sanders will change his mind and join us. And I think the DNC and the campaign should be able to work this out. I've said for — you know, for a long time that I'd be happy to have more debates, and I hope we can get this done.
MATTHEWS: Well, if he doesn't show up, will you?
CLINTON: Well, let's hope that we can get it worked out. I don't want to — you know, I don't want to jump the gun and create more problems for everybody trying to get this worked out, so we can all come to agreement that the voters of New Hampshire and America deserve to see us, you know, debating before the New Hampshire primary.
MATTHEWS: So you won't be there — just a last question on this. You won't be there unless Bernie's there.
CLINTON: Well, I'm not committing to that, either, Chris. I think we should have another debate. I think people want it. They have called for it. Folks have moved forward trying to get it set up. We've got, you know — look, 24 hours in a political campaign is an eternity.
MATTHEWS: Right.
CLINTON: We've got a little time to try to get everybody on board, which would certainly be my preference.
MATTHEWS: OK, you believe candidates should have the courage to face each other before the — before the caucuses, in other words. You think you should be there and he should be there.
CLINTON: I do. I think that — you know, I agreed, we all agreed to go with the process that the DNC had set up. And you know, I've been saying for a while that if they come up with more debates, I will be there. And now we've got a real, live possibility, and I — I personally think it would be great for the — you know, the primary. We're moving into the caucus, as you know so well, on Monday.
MATTHEWS: OK...
CLINTON: And then once we come out of there, whatever happens, we should agree to debate in New Hampshire.
MATTHEWS: In other words, you're sticking to your commitment, I will be there.
CLINTON: I will — I will debate. Now, as I say, I'd want — I want all the campaigns and the DNC to agree. That is my preference.
MATTHEWS: OK.
CLINTON: That's what we've tried to, you know, do in our side of the ledger here.
MATTHEWS: OK.
CLINTON: And I'm pushing people to come to agreement so we can all get out there and debate before the New Hampshire primary.
MATTHEWS: Well, this is getting very sharply worded as we get closer to the caucuses. The word in ""The New York Times"" this morning, Madam Secretary, is that Senator Sanders is readying an attack ad against you. We don't know whether he's going to use it, but the language is basically that you're in hock to Wall Street because of the speaking fees you've taken from Goldman Sachs. How do you respond or how will you respond to an eleventh-hour attack like that?
CLINTON: Well, first, it's really disappointing, Chris. You know, Senator Sanders has started to get increasingly personal with his attacks. He even compared me to Dick Cheney last week, which, you know, is kind of a low blow. So it would be another escalation and a breaking of his pledge not to go negative. One of the things that I think has been great about the Democratic side is we really have focused on issues, while the Republicans have been hurling insults. And I think the people in Iowa want to go to the caucuses thinking about which one of us as president can actually make a difference in their lives, and that's the case I've been focused on making. So you know, it would be a sharp departure by Senator Sanders. And you know, the other part of this, is anybody who knows me knows you can't buy me. I mean, honestly, I've been standing up and fighting and getting knocked around for years, trying to get things done that I think would improve people's lives. And I'm not going to stop, and that includes anybody trying to, you know, mess with our financial system.
MATTHEWS: Well, when he uses phrases like — dark phrases like, You can draw your own conclusions, as to whether you're in hock to Goldman Sachs or anyone — is that — is that a low blow, You can draw your own conclusions?
CLINTON: Well, I think he's trying to go to the line without going over it. And you know, clearly, some of the journalists covering us are starting to notice and call him out on it. But I feel very — you know, very positive and energized by what I'm seeing happening here in Iowa. And I know that I have the best plan to rein in Wall Street abuses, to make sure it doesn't ever happen again. Lots of folks, from Barney Frank to Paul Krugman, have said that's the case because I don't just go after the big banks. You know, we already have the authority to do that under Dodd-Frank, and I have said I would use that authority if they were posing a systemic risk to our economy. But equally importantly, we've got to go after the shadow banking sector. You know, let's not forget Lehman Brothers, AIG, Countrywide, Rapovia. And let's also remind people, Chris, that, clearly, the billionaires, as Bernie likes to say — the billionaires have chosen sides. They're running ads against me and trying to, you know, kind of hoodwink Democrats into voting against me because they know exactly what I will do because they've seen me in action. So whether it's, you know, Karl Rove or the hedge fund guys with their own super-PAC, or Joe Ricketts jumping in now with a kind of ham-handed effort to look like he was, you know, going against Bernie, when the real point was to, you know, stir opposition to me. I take that as perversely flattering and as the single best refutation of what Senator Sanders is trying to imply.
MATTHEWS: Well, you're giving us a real rogue's gallery here of Dick Cheney and Karl Rove. [laughter]
Anyway, let me ask you about the slogans. You used a phrase the other day, these shouting slogans. Now, I know what you mean — I'm going to build a wall across the Rio Grande — across — along the Rio Grande River. I'm going to make the Mexicans pay for it. But on the Democratic side, Senator Sanders says things like free health care, or rather, government-paid health care for life, as a right. He talks about free tuition when you go to a great school like Berkeley or Madison, Wisconsin. Free! Free! Is that what you mean, this — we had a young guy on yesterday from South Carolina who switched from you to Senator Sanders, and he — I went through this list of free things and I said, Where's the money come from? And he says, Well, we put a man on the moon. We can do this. And that kind of fantastic — what do you call it — appeal. And then I heard from Sanders the other day that they're going to stay left, right to the general, they're not going to make any appeal to the middle. How do you beat somebody who promises to go hard left, right to November, and offers all this stuff to people who are 20 years old, 22 years old, and they don't have to pay much taxes now, but you say, Look, you're going to get free — no more tuition bills, no more bills! You're going to have no health care the rest of your life, so forget having to buy insurance. It's a pretty good offer. Is that what you mean by shouting slogans?
CLINTON: Well, I was really more referring to the Republicans, as you pointed out initially. And I have been, you know, pointing out the differences in the approach between myself and Senator Sanders because I know that it's more important we actually make progress than fall back into gridlock. And let's take health care as an example. You know, we've been trying, as Democrats, since Harry Truman to get on the path to universal coverage. Before it was called ""Obama care,"" it was called ""Hillary care,"" and I have the scars to prove it. And I was thrilled when President Obama passed and signed the Affordable Care Act. We are now at 90 percent coverage. I sure think we ought to improve it. I've got plans to get the costs down and make sure we do go after high prescription drug costs and some of the other drivers of health care costs. But I think it's a lot smarter to try to go from 90 percent to 100 percent than to throw our country into another contentious debate about health care. Where's the money going to come from? Who's going to be paying it? If you have health care you like, if you're under a private plan, do you have to give it up? If you're on Medicare and you work, do you have to pay more taxes? All these questions that would be thrown back into the public arena and we'd have to start all over again from 0 to 100 percent. I just think we want to stay on the path of making progress. Now, some people, you know, say, Oh my gosh, that's so pragmatic. It's not, you know, soaring, or whatever they say. Well, I'm out there talking to people who prescription drug costs have gone up from $200 to $14,000. I'm talking to people whose insulin cost has gone up three times. That's not a new drug. That doesn't have any new research in it. I'm talking to people who are thanking me for the Affordable Care Act because the lifetime limit, the cap has been lifted. And a man yesterday in Davenport said to me, I'm so grateful because I've got a granddaughter with a congenital heart condition. These people can't wait, Chris. We can't wait for another big debate that promises, you know, the sky when we know we've got to deliver on the ground. We've got to help people deal with the problems, the issues, the challenges they're facing right now. We have to restore faith that our government can work. And that is what I intend to do as president, and I'm going to keep fighting for that. And I respect the goal because Senator Sanders and I share the same goal. We want to get to universal coverage. I think my way will get us there faster and provide the health care that the people here in Iowa are telling me they are desperately, desperately in need of.
MATTHEWS: Last question, and it's so important to this campaign. I think so. I know you think so. It has to do with history. And it's not the only issue in the campaign, obviously, but if you look at the American Constitution — and you've studied constitutional law — and the fact is that it wasn't until after the civil war that African-American men were given the right to vote in the 15th Amendment. And then women didn't get it until after the First World War. There's a long lag there. Obama was elected president. You might get elected president. You may well get elected president. Do you think it's — you think young American women — say, young women in college, 18 to 22, 23 — do they get it, how long this struggle has been and the fact that it's a precarious struggle that could fall back? Do they know that all the rights to choice, to equality at workplace, where they do get it, all were fought for? Do they get it? That's my simple question. I don't know if they do. Do you think they get it?
CLINTON: Look, I think that a lot of young people — and I wouldn't limit it to women. I think young people of every background, every racial, ethnic, religious background, are, you know, trying to understand how best they can participate in our political system and what the stakes are for them. And of course, you know, if you haven't been through a lot of these struggles, it's easy either not to know about them or to think they didn't go far enough or that, you know, everything is taken care of. So we've got the two extremes of the argument. But here's what I'm hearing, at least from the young women who come to see me. They say, Hey, OK, you're for equal pay. What are you going to make sure I get it? I had a young woman the other day here in Iowa say, I want to go to law school. How can I be sure that if I work hard and do well and get a job, I'm going to get equal pay? And I said, OK, that's the right question because we've been fighting for this. We've made progress, but not near enough. Here's exactly what I think we need to do to get it. Or young women who say, you know, I can't balance family and work. I had a young woman come to see me holding her 9-month-old baby and she said, you know, I can't go back to work until I get my baby stabilized. I need paid family leave. What are you going to do about it? So I think what's happening is, as the campaign goes on, a lot of young people — and let's focus on young women — are moving from the sort of general, either we haven't gone far enough or those fights are over and I don't have to worry about it, to being much more specific. And that is a good development because at the end of our efforts here in the primaries, and if I'm so fortunate enough to get the nomination, then I think we fight out an election between a party that believes we've got to continue to address the lacks in our drive for equality, our drive for justice, whether it's racism, sexism, homophobia, you name it — we need to address those gaps, and the other side doesn't even want to admit they exist. So I think we're going to have a very positive reaction in the general election between, you know, the big deniers on the Republican side, and you know, Let's make progress, get things done, on my side.
MATTHEWS: Thank you so much. One last — just to clarify what you said about the debate. Would you like the chairman — the chair of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, to approve the MSNBC/NBC debate next week?
CLINTON: I would like the chairmen of the party and the campaigns to agree that we can debate in New Hampshire next week.
MATTHEWS: OK.
CLINTON: That is what I'm hoping will happen.
MATTHEWS: OK. Thank you so much. It's been an honor to have you on, Secretary Hillary Clinton from Iowa. Thanks for joining us on HARDBALL tonight.
CLINTON: Thanks, Chris. Good to talk to you again.

[crosstalk]
Let's talk about that ""Des Moines Register"" — that ""Des Moines Register"" poll that has you in the lead — eight years ago, your hopes were dashed by that surge of new voters for Barack Obama. Are you confident that won't happen again?
CLINTON: Well, George, here's what I'm confident about. We've run a terrific campaign from the grassroots up. I feel so proud and grateful to the thousands of Iowans who have joined this campaign. And we're going to keep working as hard as I can and everybody else, until the caucuses conclude tomorrow night. Of course, it's close. It's competitive. That's why I hope everybody who has decided to caucus for me will be sure to come out on Monday night.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You did have that surprise on Friday; the State Department saying they will not release 22 emails of yours deemed top secret. You want them released. Why are you so confident that release would not compromise national security? What do you know about those emails that we don't?
CLINTON: Well, here's what I know. I know that this is, I think, a continuation of the story that has been playing out for months. There is no classified marked information on those emails sent or received by me. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, who's had a chance to review them, has said that this email chain did not originate with me and that there were no classification markings. So I do want them released and of course I can't be clear about exactly what the reasons might be for some in the government, as part of this interagency dispute, to make this request not to make them public. But I would like to see them disclosed and I think they can. It should be disclosed —
[crosstalk]
STEPHANOPOULOS: Your supporters —
CLINTON: — that I'm told about them.
STEPHANOPOULOS: — your supporters including Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, former governor of Iowa, and Senator Feinstein herself, has suggested it's political. Is that what you think?
CLINTON: Well, it's — I'm going to leave that to others who are quite experienced in the ways of Washington to comment on. I just have to point out that the timing and some of the leaks that have led up to it are concerning. And I just want this matter resolved. The best way to resolve is to do what I asked months ago, release these, let the public see them and let's move on.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, you've said many times that the emails were not marked classified. No evidence that that's not true. But the non-disclosure agreement you signed as secretary of state said that that really is not that relevant. It says classified information is marked or unmarked classified and that all of your training to treat all of that sensitively and should know the difference.
CLINTON: Well, of course. And that's exactly what I did. I take classified information very seriously. You know, you can't get information off the classified system in the State Department to put onto an unclassified system, no matter what that system is. We were very specific about that and you — when you receive information, of course, there has to be some markings, some indication that someone down the chain had thought that this was classified and that was not the case. The final thing I would say because clearly the best answer to all of this is release and disclose these materials is that what I'm told is that this chain of emails very well included a published newspaper report. That seems a little hard to understand, that we would be retroactively over classifying a public newspaper article. So let's just get it out. Let's see what it is and let the American people draw their own conclusions. This is very much like Benghazi, George. You know, the Republicans are going to continue to use it, beat up on me. I understand that. That's the way they are. But after 11 hours of testimony, answering every single question, in public, which I have requested for many months, I think it's pretty clear they're grasping at straws and this will turn out —
[crosstalk]
STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally on this matter, you know, a few months back, you told my colleague, David Mir it was a mistake to set up this private server. Yet just this Monday, you said there was no error in judgment. How do you square those two statements?
CLINTON: Well, look, as I've said many times, it was permitted. My predecessors had engaged in a similar practice. It was not the best choice. I wouldn't be here talking to you about it. I'd be talking about what people in Iowa are talking to me about, about affordable health care and jobs and rising wages and all of the concerns that are on their minds. And be, you know, really able to answer their questions as I have been now for so many months.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You and Senator Sanders really going at it right now. And here was — he was on the stump there yesterday, saying this about your attack.
[begin video clip]
SANDERS: Don't tell me that I'm defending or protecting the gun lobby. Don't tell me I'm attacking Planned Parenthood. Those are inaccuracies. And we can do better than that.
[end video clip]
STEPHANOPOULOS: He's calling you on this, says he got a D- rating from the NRA and 100 percent record with Planned Parenthood.
CLINTON: Well, let me tell you what the people who work on these issues every day have said. They say I'm the leader. I'm the leader who has taken on tough issues. I've taken on difficult issues like Planned Parenthood, the gun lobby, for many years. And they concluded to endorse me by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. I was very honored to have that. That's not saying that others haven't voted with them. But they were looking for a leader and they found it with me. I've been endorsed by The Brady Campaign and yesterday in a very emotional event in Ames, Iowa, endorsed by Gabby Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, because they believe I'm the leader that they want to stand up to the gun lobby, the same with the Human Rights Campaign. They concluded I was the leader to protect and advance the cause of the rights of the LGBT community. Now that is just the facts. People who have known us, people who have evaluated us, people who have concluded what they want in the next president have sided with me. And I'm very proud of that.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, you just mentioned [inaudible] hitting you with the email issue. They're clearly going to hit Bernie Sanders with the fact that he's a Democratic socialist if he gets the nomination. Some of your supporters concerned about that, Senator Claire McCaskill, are saying they can't wait to run an ad with a hammer and a sickle. Steny Hoyer, Congressman Steny Hoyer, saying he calls himself a socialist. I don't think that's a good title to be running for President of the United States. Is that what you think? Will the fact that he's a Democratic socialist make it harder for Democrats to win in November?
CLINTON: Well, that certainly is what a lot of Democratic leaders are saying. And I take them at their word. They know their states. They know the country. They know we have to take back the Senate. They want to make some advances in the House as well as at governor and legislature levels across the country. Here's what I think. I think I've been subjected, as you know so well, to years of scrutiny and I'm still standing, talking to you in the lead here in Iowa for the caucuses and going on after that. And it's a very tough gantlet to run. And if there are issues, that Republicans and their allies on the Right believe they could use to bring down a Democratic, they're going to use it. I feel vetted. I feel ready. I feel strong and I think I'm the best person to be the nominee and to defeat whoever they nominate in November.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, I wonder what your response to this quote from your old friend, Robert Rice, Secretary of Labor under President Clinton. He said you're the most qualified candidate for the political system we now have. But Bernie Sanders is the most qualified candidate to create the political system we should have. How do you respond to that?
CLINTON: Well, look, I'm a progressive who thinks it's important to actually make progress. That's what I've done my entire life. That's what I will do as president. Obviously I have big goals. I want to get to universal coverage; I want to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. Get incomes rising, get women equal pay, raise the minimum wage, have a renaissance in manufacturing, move toward clean, renewable energy — I have big goals. And I tell you how I'm going to get there and how I'm going to pay for them. And I think that is what the Americans want. I'm not going to sit here and overpromise and under-deliver. I'm going to tell you what I know we can achieve, and that's going to take the political system we have right now, and then I intend to bring in more people, as always have, George. When I ran for Senate the first time, you remember, you know, people didn't give me much of a chance. I won and then when I was reelected, I won with a bigger percentage. And then when I was Secretary of State, even the Republicans said I was doing a good job. So I understand politics. I understand a campaign. I am focused on my mission to make sure this country works for everybody, particularly hardworking middle-class families who rightly feel they've been left out and left behind. I think I know how to do that, and I think the voters know that I know how to do that.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Secretary Clinton, thanks for joining us this morning.
CLINTON: Great to talk to you, George. Thank you.
STEPHANOPOULOS: And we will be right back with Bernie Sanders.

What a night. An unbelievable night. What a great campaign. This has been an incredible honor to campaign across Iowa, with so many of you to make the case for the kind of future we want.
For the Democratic Party and for the United States of America. There is so much at stake in this election, I don't need to tell you. Every single one of you who came out for me, who worked so many hours — from my young organizers with energy and passion to the families and friends across this state — I am deeply grateful.
I love all of you. Here's what I want you to know. It is rare that we have the opportunity we do now, to have a real contest of ideas. To really think hard about what the Democratic Party stands for and what we want the future of our country to look like if we do our part to build it.
I am a progressive who gets things done for people. I am honored to stand in the long line of American reformers who make up our minds that the status quo is not good enough. That standing still is not an option. And that brings people together to find ways forward that will improve the lives of Americans. I look back over the years of my involvement from the very first job I had at the Children's Defense Fund. And I know. I know what we are capable of doing, I know we can create more good paying jobs and raise incomes for hardworking Americans again. I know that we can finish the job of universal health care coverage for every single man, woman, and child.
I know we can combat climate change and be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. I know we can make our education system work for every one of our children, especially those who come with disadvantages. I know we can make college affordable and get student debt off the backs of young people. And I know we can protect our rights, women's rights, gay rights, voting rights, immigrant rights, workers rights. I know too we can stand up to the gun lobby and get common sense gun safety measures.
And how do we do that? We do that by securing the nomination, and then we do it by winning and going into that White House as others before have, determined to push forward on the great goals and values that unite us as Americans.
I congratulate my esteemed friends and opponents; I wish Governor O'Malley the very best. He is a great public servant who has served Maryland and our country and I am excited about really getting into the debate with Senator Sanders about the best way forward to fight for us and America. In the last few weeks, we finally began to have what I think is one of the most important substantive conversations that the Democratic party could have. And I am thrilled at all of the people who are playing a part in that.
I know that we may have differences of opinion about how best to achieve our goals. But I believe we have a very clear idea that the Democratic Party and this campaign stands for what is best in America. And we have to be united. When it is all said and done, we have to be united.
A Republican vision and candidates that would drive us apart and divide us. That is not who we are, my friends. I follow their candidates very closely, I understand what they're appealing to, and I intend to stand against it. I will not — I will not let their decisiveness, their efforts to rip away the progress that we've made, be successful. Because we can't afford that. As I stand here tonight, breathing a big sigh of relief, thank you, Iowa. I want you to know, I will keep doing what I have done my entire life.
I will keep standing up for you. I will keep fighting for you. I will always work to achieve the America that I believe in, where the promise of that dream that we hold out to our children and our grandchildren never fades, but inspires generations to come. Join me, let's go win the nomination. Thank you all and God bless you.

Thank you so much for doing that. And so do you have the victory party all set for tonight?
CLINTON: Well, this is a very tight race, Robin. It's really going down to the wire. But we feel very good, we've worked so hard. I've had a great operation here. So many young people, organizers who fanned out across the state, the thousands of volunteers. We did knock on 125,000 doors this past weekend. So we're very committed, very energized and enthusiastic, but it all depends upon who shows up tonight, who comes out to caucus in Iowa. And I'm urging everyone who is interested in, committed to caucusing for me to please be there tonight, 6:30. I will be there in spirit, because if you stand up for me, I will stand up for you during this campaign and into the White House.
ROBERTS: You know, there are so many similarities between what is going on right now and eight years ago. You again are affected — unexpected challenge that you are facing. What are the differences and similarities between what you're experiencing now and what happened eight years ago here in Iowa?
CLINTON: Well, I think that I have a much better organization, to be just really clear about it. I think that we built an organization using a lot of the lessons learned, and we recruited some of the best people that you could find anywhere in the country working in Democratic politics. I think I'm a better candidate. I think that in addition to just knowing more about the caucus process and what we needed to do to build toward this night. My experience as secretary of State really deepened and intensified my understanding about what the next president will have to face. So all in all, I feel like it's a different energized effort that is really bringing in people from across the state and, indeed, across the country who know what's at stake in this election, understand how really dramatic and drastic it would be if the Republicans were to take back the White House because they would rip out the progress. We wouldn't be able to, in my view, get the economy going for everybody, get incomes rising, get affordable college, take care of the rising prescription drug costs, everything I'm talking about, which is really in response to the concerns and the worries that I hear from people as I criss-cross this state.
ROBERTS: All 99 counties you have criss-crossed, and we have seen you and we've seen your husband and we've seen your daughter as well. [laughter]
CLINTON: Well, I haven't gotten to all 99.
ROBERTS: A third of —
CLINTON: I had to — let's just say that. I don't want anybody to think that my silence is affirmation. But I've covered a lot of ground and I sure have met many thousands of people and have really learned so much. You know, that's the best part of this. It's obviously exhausting, it takes a lot of concentration. But what keeps me going are the stories that people tell me. There's something so intimate, at least in my experience because I actually try to listen to people and hear what's on their minds when someone tells you about the open heart surgery that their granddaughter had to have as a baby and how they couldn't have afforded it without the Affordable Care Act, or when a young woman says she's just drowning in student debt and needs a way out, that sticks with me. And I think that the months I've spent here listening to Iowans has really made me a better candidate and I think it will make me a better president.
ROBERTS: Well, speaking of listening to Iowans, we have John Karl. He is out and about, and he is with some voters. And, you know, a third of voters here are undecided, and let's hear what one voter has to ask you. John?
JONATHAN KARL: Hello, Robin, hello Secretary Clinton. We're with Rob here from Dennison, Iowa. Incredible thing about this. Rob, you were undecided between Hillary Clinton and John Kasich. So you don't even know which party — what's your question for Secretary Clinton?
QUESTION: Good morning, Secretary Clinton. My question for you is as a liberal Republican — it seems to be a dying breed anymore — I want to know how you're going to work bipartisanly with a very partisan Congress and a — and a seemingly polarized nation.
KARL: Good question.
CLINTON: That's a — that's a really great question, and thanks for asking it because I get asked that a lot. You know, I have a record of working with Republicans. When I'm actually in a position to do so — when, you know, there's a campaign, it's a little bit different — but when I was first lady, I worked to achieve the Children's Health Insurance Program, working across the aisle with both Republicans and Democrats, even reformed our foster care and adoption system, teaming up with Tom DeLay, a very partisan Republican in the House. And when I got to the Senate, I worked hard to get health care for the National Guard and Reserves, I worked with Senator Lindsey Graham in that case. And I — I don't know that there was a single Republican who didn't co-sponsor one of the bills that I worked on. And as secretary of State, I had similar efforts to reach common ground that proved successful. I know in a campaign that distinctions have to be drawn because we have to give voters a real sense of what each of us wants to do, and to hold us accountable for the agenda we put forth. But I am confident that I'm going to work really hard to find that common ground across the aisle, and we will make progress together.
ROBERTS: Secretary Clinton, thank you very much. We appreciate you joining us on this very busy and important day. Thank you.
CLINTON: Thanks so much. Great to talk to you.
ROBERTS: You as all — as always.

CAMEROTA: A powerful close to Hillary Clinton's last campaign event of the night Sunday. Former secretary of state spent most of the day making her way through Iowa in a last ditch effort to rally caucusgoers ahead of tonight's vote. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton joins us now. Secretary Clinton, good morning.
CLINTON: Good morning, Alisyn.
CAMEROTA: Okay. How are you feeling and how do you plan to spend the next 12 hours?
CLINTON: I am feeling great. I am so proud of the campaign we have run here in Iowa. I've got the most dedicated campaign team, the organizers who have been on the ground, the thousands of volunteers. We actually knocked on 125,000 doors this weekend. So there is just a lot of excitement and energy. I'm urging everybody to come out and caucus tonight to be part of this unique American process. I hope they will come out and caucus for me.
CAMEROTA: So, Secretary, let's talk about the issue that has bedeviled your campaign. That, of course, is the ongoing investigation into your e-mails. On Friday, the State Department withheld 22 e-mails. They didn't release them. Because of material deemed top secret. I know you have been asked this six ways to Sunday along the campaign trail and I know that you've always said there is nothing there, but your opponents have said that this is big. It's is a big deal. How do you convince voters today not to be concerned about this?
CLINTON: Well, Alisyn, there is nothing new. And I think the facts are quite helpful here. It's a little bit like what the Republicans and others have tried to do with respect to Benghazi. Just a lot of innuendo, a lot of attacks. I just know that after I testified for 11 hours, answered every question, nothing new came up. Most voters have made up their minds. And I'm grateful for that. The same here. And I think most of the voters who have followed this know exactly what's going on here. I never made any different explanation than the one that I have made over and over again. I take classified information seriously. I did not send or receive any material marked classified and I want all of these released. This is a dispute about retroactive classification, quite a mouthful. So what people talk to me about is how I'm going to get incomes up, how I'm going to make sure the Affordable Care Act works, and get prescription drug costs down, and make college affordable and relieve student debt. That's what's on voters' minds. And that's what I'm talking about and that seems to be what is exciting and energizing people as they move toward the caucus tonight.
CAMEROTA: Um but Secretary Clinton, something does seem to be happening with this investigation, or at least the FBI seems to be talking about it more, because in the past week several media outlets have said that their sources in the FBI say, quote, ""something's going to happen."" What does that mean to you?
CLINTON: It means people are selectively leaking and making comments that have no basis in anything I'm aware of. And, you know, I regret that that seems to be part of the atmosphere because we need to let this inquiry run its course, get it resolved. But I can tell you, Alisyn, that is not on the minds of the literally thousands of people that I have seen in the last few weeks. And I'm glad it isn't. Because the facts are the facts. No matter how much selective leaking or anonymous sourcing and all that kind of stuff that goes on, what people want to know is what I can do to be the best possible president for them and their families. And I've been thrilled at the kind of reaction and response I've been getting, the crowds that we had. That last event last night was just overwhelming. I'm looking forward to people coming out expressing their opinion about who can be the best president and commander in chief for the Democratic Party and then getting on to win the Democratic nomination and being successful next November.
CAMEROTA: Yesterday ""The New York Times"" endorsed you. They wrote that you are the right choice in terms of experience and vision. I'm sure that was music to your ears. Do you think ""The New York Times"" endorsement plays in Iowa?
CLINTON: Well, I don't know. But I know ""The Des Moines Register"" does and they endorsed me. I know ""The Boston Globe"" matters and a lot of the newspapers in New Hampshire that have endorsed me and this is very gratifying because, yeah, there is a lot of static that goes on and the Republicans and their allies are determined to do everything they can to try to bring me down. They don't know me very well. Because I don't quit when I'm fighting for what I believe in. And I believe that I can be the president who makes progress with people. And I'm just going to stick with it. And so when very respectable and responsible outlets like ""The Register"" or ""The Times"" or ""The Boston Globe"" and others look at all the candidates, interview us, ask us really hard questions and conclude that I'm their choice for president, I find that incredibly validating. And I do hope that voters pay attention to it because it's a pretty tough vetting process they go through.
CAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, that's talk about the Republicans and what's going on in terms of how the electorate feels. I know that you know that this campaign has been about how angry and how anxious people are feeling out there and of course all of the division in this country. Some people say we have never seen anything like it. You've made a point during the campaign of talking about how you don't really like how the Republicans do become in many ways. So how would you bring the country together, including Republicans?
CLINTON: Well, the same way I always have. When I'm not actually running for office, I work closely with everybody, including Republicans, to find common ground. That's what I did when I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program that insures 8 million kids. I worked with Democrats and Republicans. It's what I did when I got to the Senate and, you know, worked with Republicans to get health care for our National Guard and Reserve members when they weren't being deployed. I worked on responding to 9/11. I found common ground on a number of issues with respect to health care and the like. As secretary of state, the same thing. So, Alisyn, I think that you've got to work at it every single day. There is no shortcut. You have to build the relationships and you have to be willing to try to meet people where they are and move them over. That's the way politics works in America. That's the way our system is set up to work. Now we can get frustrated by it. We can wish that it were smoother. But I'm very proud of the record that President Obama has compiled. You know, the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank regulations on Wall Street, getting our economy out of the ditch. The Republicans put it into working to put those sanctions on Iran, the effort I led. And so much more. So I know how you get things done. I am a progressive who wants to make progress and actually produce real results in people's lives. That's what I'm offering. I'm not overpromising. I'm laying out the plans that I have. I'm asking people to look at them and I'm asking people to hold me accountable. Because I want to get back to working together to try to unite this country to make it possible for us to set big goals and achieve them. That's what I intend to do.
CAMEROTA: Let's talk about how this differs for you than 2008. Once again, you find yourself here in Iowa with an opponent who some think sort of came out of nowhere but who has garnered a lot of excitement. So why isn't this deja vu all over again for you today?
CLINTON: Well, look, I always thought we'd have a close contest and I think that is good. It's good for the Democratic Party. But I'm thrilled at my campaign and we learned a lot of lessons. We have applied those lessons. We have got a great team working literally around the clock. I think I'm a better candidate. I think my experience as secretary of state gave me a depth and understanding about what the next president will face that, frankly, nobody else running on either side could have. And I think that what voters are looking for is a way out of their frustration. Yeah, people are angry. People are disappointed. People are worried. You know, what happened in the Great Recession was a body blow. I mean, 9 million people lost their jobs and 5 million houses were lost and $13 trillion and family wealth was wiped out. People haven't gotten a raise. They have been working but they don't feel like they are getting ahead. So they deserve — the American people deserve to be worried. But what I'm offering is a way forward. You know, once you get through the anger and the political attacks and all the rest of it, people have to ask themselves, who can do the most for me and my family? Who can protect our country? Who can get the economy going and incomes rising and make sure the Affordable Care Act works and get prescription drug costs down? I know how to do this and I'm ready. I'm experienced and I think I have got the best shot at becoming both the nominee and the next president.
CAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, we will be watching, of course, with great interest what unfolds over the next 12 hours. Thanks so much for taking time to be on NEW DAY.
CLINTON: Thank you. Hope you feel better. Take care.
CAMEROTA: Thank you. Thank you. That's so nice. I'm drinking tea and honey right now. Thanks so much.

38,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5000,"February 2, 2016",Interview with Chris Matthews of MSNBC,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111590,Hillary Clinton,"MATTHEWS: Madam Secretary, thank you for joining us. It was quite a night last night and I was taken with your moment of candor there before the cameras when you said, you had a sigh of relief. Tell us about that sigh of relief and what it meant to you.
CLINTON: Right. Oh, Chris, it meant the world to me. As we all remember, I was not successful in Iowa last time and I know how hard that caucus process is. So proud of our organization, our volunteers, all my supporters. Everybody said if there were a big turnout, that would advantage Senator Sanders. There was a big turnout, and we won. And now I'm in New Hampshire looking forward to the primary next Tuesday and continuing to make my case in this contest of ideas between me and the senator.
MATTHEWS: Well, you know, ""The New York Times"" ran this story this morning that you were disappointed, and I think it's possible to be both disappointed and relieved. You could have been disappointed at 9:00 but very relieved at 11:00. I mean, the times change during the course as the results come in. Are both those possible? You thought you could have done better with your field operation but you're also glad you came out ahead?
CLINTON: Look, Chris, I really believe that during the last few weeks leading up to the caucus, I could feel the energy building. It's a tough process and what I was seeing on the ground as people were telling me they were changing their minds, that they were supporting me, what my organizers were reporting, was all consistent that it was going to be close, but if we did our work, and we did, we would win. So I was thrilled by winning and getting that boost out of Iowa here in New Hampshire where I am in Senator Sanders' backyard, as you know, as a political expert of your many years, that New Hampshire votes for neighbors. And so I have to really get out there, make my case, which I intend to do this week.
MATTHEWS: I just love the way you snuck that in. It's his backyard, therefore he has an advantage geographically and we shouldn't put too much stock into it. But let me ask you about this, because I'm looking at these polls. There's a range in the polling over the last couple weeks in New Hampshire and it is his back yard. Look at the map, it's Vermont and New Hampshire right next to each other, twin there. Between 6 and 33 points he's got a lead on you up there, and I wonder how much ground you can make in a week, because we only have a week now.
CLINTON: I feel really good about my campaign in New Hampshire and I remember getting off the plane in New Hampshire after the Iowa caucuses last time where I did not win, and I was way behind going into what was then just five days before the primary. And the work that was done on my behalf, the people who came out to support me, the incredible excitement — I saw that today in Nashua. I got here, it was amazing, Chris. The level of enthusiasm, people who were with me before, people who were with President Obama in '08, everybody working so hard to support me, to get to that primary, to do everything we possibly can. We're not leaving anything on the ground. We're moving forward. And I think we'll do well.
MATTHEWS: I think everybody should have been impressed. Maybe I wasn't as impressed as I should have been, but everybody should have been, about the way you handled New Hampshire last time around. You came off the loss in Iowa. You went out there and you would stand there — it was like Bill Clinton staying there until the last dog died. You were out there on that arena, I remember you standing in a, I think it was a field house, and you went on and on and on. It went on for five hours. It was incredible. It was a marathon, answering every single question of everyone in that room. It really was a physical — a marathon. Are you going to try to match that performance this time, that kind of ""I can do this"" thing?
CLINTON: I'm going to do everything I can to get out there, to meet with folks here, to answer their questions. I'm really happy we've got a forum on CNN tomorrow night. We've got your MSNBC debate on Thursday night, which will give us a chance to reach a larger audience. But I'm going to be there day after day between now and Tuesday. I respect this primary process. I know how seriously people take it. And I just want them to understand what I'm offering, what I believe we can do. You know, ideas that sound good on paper but can't create results for people are just that, good ideas on paper. I have a track record of producing results. I know how to do all parts of this job. Because we're going to be voting for both a president and a commander in chief. And in New Hampshire, those two sides of this incredibly difficult job are really joined together. And I feel good about the opportunity I'll have to get out, meet with granite staters, make my case, and I'm going to do everything possible to get them to support me next Tuesday.
MATTHEWS: I know you've been saying nice things about your only opponent now. It's really a battle since Martin O'Malley, Governor O'Malley has withdrawn. It's a two-person race. The only person, and I'm going to say this bluntly — the only person between a confirmed socialist who's calling for political revolution in this country, winning the nomination of the Democratic party, which has always been more moderate than that, is you. So when you saw that rally last night, the young people all around Senator Sanders, when he yelled revolution out there and they all applauded like mad, do you think that's something that is going to help in a general election, or are we looking at, what we used to call in the 60s, an NDC campaign — November doesn't count. We just want to win the party, we don't care about the general. You seem to be focused on the general. How do you beat a person who's coming along in the primaries, however, who's saying, I'm going to give you all the things you want, free tuition, more social security benefits without an increase in your taxes, healthcare from birth to death, all government paid. How do you compete with a revolution of promises, really?
CLINTON: Well first, let me say, I am thrilled, too, that we've got young people getting active in the campaign on the Democratic side. I was very proud of the many, many young people working for me, volunteering for me, voting, caucusing for me in Iowa, and the ones I have here in New Hampshire, I'm just so impressed with. So that's a net good no matter what. I do think that we have an obligation to keep people focused on what's at stake in this election, and you got close to saying it, Chris. We can't let the Republicans rip away the progress we've made. We can't let them go back to trickle-down economics, repeal the affordable care act, we can't let them stack the supreme court for another generation against common sense kind of changes that we need. We've got to get back to the middle, we've got to get back to the big center, we've got to get back to solving problems. That's how we make progress in America. I am proud to be in a line of Democratic presidents who just got in there and fought it out, who got civil rights, who got an economy producing high incomes, who got, finally, the affordable care act, something we've been fighting for since Harry Truman. I know how hard this is and I totally appreciate how exciting it can be to be involved in a campaign that really just puts out these great big ideas. But I want folks to stop and think, no matter what age you are, OK, we agree on getting the economy going. We agree on raising incomes, we agree on combating climate change, we agree on universal coverage. Who has the track record? Who's gotten the results? Who can actually produce the kind of change you want for yourself and your family and for our country? So I'm very energized about this because I like a contest of ideas. That's what politics should be about. We're going to be talking about and arguing about issues on our side, they're going to keep insulting each other on the Republican side, but the goal for any sensible American has to be, do not turn the white house over to the Republicans in November. Do not turn the supreme court further over to their nominees. We can't let that happen.
MATTHEWS: Well, of course, I think you're offering a lesson in civics and I wonder if we can do that in a couple weeks now. Look, the history of the Democratic party, your party, not Bernie Sanders, he's not a Democratic party member — your party has produced The New Deal. It produced, the progressive income tax came from the Democrats, from Wilson. Social security, the greatest anti-poverty program ever, came from Roosevelt. And Harry Truman started to fight for health care and civil rights and all these good things that led to the affordable care act. But in every case, you had to battle Republicans who voted against it to the last person. And it's always been a tough fight. You need 60 votes in the senate, you need, what is it, 218 in the house, and if you don't have it, nothing gets done. The Bernie people need to be taught, not him, he won't be taught — the kids behind him need to be told, this is how it works in our system. You can call for revolution, but it ain't going to happen. There isn't going to be a revolution. There's going to be an election, an inauguration, and then there's going to be a congress sitting with you you've got to do business with, no matter who gets elected. You don't have to worry about logic anymore, just, I'm going to have a revolution and pay for everything.
CLINTON: Well, where I come out on this is, I don't think our country or the American people can wait. I don't think they can wait for better jobs with rising incomes, getting prescription drug costs down. I think people want to vote for somebody who is going to get in there on the first day, knows how to do the job, is prepared to do the job, and gets to work. And I will give everything I've got to make sure that we preserve the progress we've made, because you're right, it is hard fought. Our system is set up to make it difficult. Checks and balances, separation of powers — our founders knew that if we were going to survive as a great democracy that they were creating, we had to have a system that kept the passions at bay. We had to have people who were willing to roll up their sleeves and compromise. We couldn't have idealogues who were just hurling their rhetoric back and forth. We had to actually produce results. That hasn't changed since George Washington. We've got to produce results now because a democracy is a fragile organism, Chris. People have to believe they have a stake in it, that their voices count, that their votes count. But then they've got to see results from their investment in our democracy. Our democracy has to work better, our economy has to work better, our politics has to work better. That's what I know how to do and that's what we have to get done in this election.
MATTHEWS: Madame secretary, unofficially, not on behalf of MSNBC or NBC, congratulations on last night and your much deserved relief and break a leg on Thursday night even if you're the only one in the chair. Thank you for joining us today.
CLINTON: I'm going to be there.
MATTHEWS: You said it, I believe you. Thank you.
CLINTON: I'll be there. Bye-bye.
MATTHEWS: Thank you.

39,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5000,"February 2, 2016",Interview with Wolf Blitzer of CNN,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111591,Hillary Clinton,"BLITZER: The breaking news this hour. It's now official. Hillary Clinton has been declared the winner of the Iowa caucuses. She beat Bernie Sanders by a razor-thin margin just 0.2 of a percentage point. Her campaign claimed victory overnight but the Iowa Democratic Party has just issued the final results. They say Hillary Clinton is the winner of the Iowa caucuses. And Secretary Clinton is joining us now from Nashua, New Hampshire. Madam Secretary, thanks very much for joining us. What's your reaction to the official results now declaring you the winner of the Iowa caucuses?
CLINTON: I am so thrilled, Wolf. I feel really good and very grateful to the team I had on the ground, to the tens of thousands of Iowans who volunteered, knocked on doors, came out and caucused last night. And I could feel the energy building in the weeks leading up to the caucus. I was out there, making my case about what I want to do and what I think our country must do to get real results with more jobs, rising incomes, build on the Affordable Care Act, deal with climate change, clean energy, defend our rights, all the things I feel passionate about. And I could just watch and, in fact, in that last week I had so many people come up to me and say that they had decided to support me and it could not have been better. It was a great, great night.
BLITZER: You said last night you breathed a big sigh of relief, your words — a big sigh of relief. What did you mean by that?
CLINTON: Well, as you recall, my luck was not that good last time around. And it was wonderful to win the caucus and to have that experience of all the hard work, the grassroots organizing pay off the way it did. Now we're here in New Hampshire and we are going to have a contest of ideas. I'm looking forward to the forum tomorrow night on CNN and then a debate Thursday night, here in New Hampshire, because I think that Democratic voters and other Americans want to know what are the principal differences between me and my friend and opponent, Senator Sanders. And I want to get that information out there. I think it's important people understand that good ideas are one thing but you got to know how to implement. You've got to have a record of getting results. And I'm taking my ideas and my record to the people of New Hampshire this week.
BLITZER: The Sanders campaign says they won't have this debate Thursday night with you unless you agree to a subsequent debate before the New York primary in New York City. Are you willing to agree to that?
CLINTON: Well, you know, Wolf, this is really hard to follow because, when we said we would do the debate, they came back with conditions. We met the conditions. Then they said they want different conditions. And we've tried to be very accommodating but, you know, we have agreed with everything that they have asked us to do. And I sure hope — we're in Bernie Sanders' backyard here in New Hampshire. I sure hope he intends to show up in his neighboring state and let the people of New Hampshire see us both on the debate stage.
BLITZER: Well, just to press the point, the debate in New York City that they want, are you accepting that?
CLINTON: No. We've accepted all of their conditions. We did that last week. And they keep trying to add new conditions, which, you know, raises questions about how ready or willing they are to debate here in New Hampshire. We met their conditions. We agreed to more debates, something that I wanted to do because I think it's great to debate and we're ready. I'm going to be there Thursday night.
BLITZER: All right. Let's move on. The senator's campaign — they want to do not necessarily a recount but they want to check the voting in Iowa. Is that OK with you?
CLINTON: You know, look, I — they — I can say that I believe the Democratic Party of Iowa ran a good caucus from everything that our people told me. There was an enormous turnout, which everybody said would tremendously favor Senator Sanders. If there are legitimate issues, both sides, I don't think the Democratic Party has any problems with that. But from everything we have learned and know, I won and I'm very proud of that.
BLITZER: Back in 2008, as you well remember, you lost Iowa but then you came back to win New Hampshire. This time you won Iowa. Can you win New Hampshire one week from today?
CLINTON: Well, I think it's certainly what I'm aiming for. I care a lot about this state. I view it as being the first-in-the-nation primary for a reason. I know that they tend to favor their neighbors. That's the pattern, the history of the primary. And Senator Sanders is a neighbor. But I think we will have a good contest, talking about what results we can produce, what our records have been, both in domestic policy, foreign policy, national security and I think the people of New Hampshire will get a chance to really evaluate both of us. And I feel good about my prospects.
BLITZER: You described yourself in your speech last night as a progressive that gets things done. Are you suggesting Bernie Sanders — he may be a progressive but he can't get things done?
CLINTON: I'm talking about my record. I'm talking about the Children's Health Insurance Program for 8 million kids. I'm talking about getting health care for National Guard members. I'm talking about helping to push through a treaty to lower nuclear weapons between us and the Russians when I was secretary of state. I'm talking about building the coalition against Iran to bring them to the negotiating table and so many other issues. I have a very long record of getting results for people. That's what I care about. You know, I am all for laying out our ideology, talking about our ideas. I think that's great and it gives you the direction that you want to head. But at the end of the day, what matters to me is that we move our country forward. We actually get more good jobs with rising incomes. We get equal pay for women. We actually begin to move toward early childhood education and paid family leave. And we are ready to really go into the rest of the 21st century with the kind of confidence and optimism that I think our country should be having. So I'm going to lay out my record, lay out my ideas and Senator Sanders can certainly lay out his own and we'll leave it up to the people of New Hampshire to decide what they think is the best choice for them and their families and the results they want to see for themselves in our country.
BLITZER: As you know, according to the entrance polls in Iowa, Bernie Sanders did a lot better than you did with younger voters, younger men and even younger women. Why do you think is he doing so well with younger voters out there?
CLINTON: I'm thrilled to see so many young people get into the political process and I was very proud of all the young people who worked for me, volunteered for me, supported me. That's all to the good and it's great for the Democratic Party. But I'm going to have some work to do to reach out to young voters, maybe first-time voters, who have to make a tough decision as they evaluate who should be our president, our commander in chief, and I intend to do that, laying out my case, where we contrast on the issues, what I think can be done to get college to be affordable. I think my plan is going to really help the people who need it most without ballooning costs. I'm going to set forth my plan to refinance student debt, a problem I hear throughout New Hampshire and the country and why I think my plan will help more young people really get started with their lives. The emphasis I want to make on small business, my call that young people join our campaign and then be part of making us the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. And let's defend our rights. I am very proud that I got the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, that I got the endorsement of the Human Rights Campaign, that I got the endorsement of The Brady Campaign and Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly and so many others, because they know me and they know what I have done. They know the kind of leader I am. And I want young people to know that as well.
BLITZER: As you know, Marco Rubio did rather well, coming in at an impressive third place in the Iowa Republican caucuses just behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz won Iowa. What do you think about the possibility, if you do get the Democratic nomination, of running against Senator Rubio in a general election?
CLINTON: You know, Wolf, I'm not thinking that far ahead. My timeframe is next Tuesday and the primary in New Hampshire and then I'll go on to the caucuses in Nevada and the primary at the end of the month in South Carolina and then to the states that lie ahead. I'm going let the Republicans, you know, decide who their nominee will be. I will be prepared to run against and win, no matter who they nominate. I think, as everybody is well aware, I am pretty battle tested. It's important to have gone through this, to know what the Republicans will do. They're already running $6 million of ads against me along with their, you know, Wall Street buddies. And so they know who they don't want to be the Democratic nominee. And I take that as perversely flattering because they also know that I mean what I say and I'll do what I have said, to make sure that they don't ever wreck our economy again. So I'm going take them on as I have over the years and then, when I win, I will certainly reach out, work with them and find common ground wherever we can.
BLITZER: Madam Secretary, thanks very much for joining us. Congratulations on your win in Iowa.
CLINTON: Thank you so much, Wolf. Great to talk to you again.
BLITZER: Thank you.

Thanks very much for being with us. You heard from Senator Bernie Sanders. Please welcome the former secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. [applause]
Please.
CLINTON: Hello.
COOPER: Welcome.
CLINTON: Thank you very much.
COOPER: So you've obviously had a pretty incredible several past couple of days. Congratulations on winning in Iowa. New Hampshire has always been good to the Clintons. How does it feel out there?
CLINTON: It feels great. I've had just an amazing time. We landed in the middle of the night from Iowa still pretty pumped up about winning there, and then got to work the next day. And I'm seeing a lot of old friends, meeting a lot of new people. I have an uphill climb and I'm going to climb as high and hard as I can because I want to make my case for the people of New Hampshire. As you said, they're people that I feel very close to. They've been good to my husband, to me, my family. But what's most important is the first in the nation primary. It truly is a great opportunity to get out there, explain what you want to do as president, present your ideas, and get vetted by the people of New Hampshire.
COOPER: Bernie Sanders, just a short time ago, said he is the underdog here. Your campaign has said, you know, he comes from neighboring Vermont, you guys are down in the polls. Do you feel you do better when you're fighting from behind?
CLINTON: You know, I don't know. I...
COOPER: Does it bring out something in you?
CLINTON: Well, the intensity of the experience and the importance of trying to convey what's at stake in this election, because to me obviously Tuesday is a really big deal with the primary. But the goal has to be to prevent the Republicans from getting back into the White House and undoing all the progress that has been made under President Obama. [applause]
And so I — I'm very proud of the campaign that Senator Sanders and I are running. I mean, we really have focused on issues. We share a lot of the same big progressive goals, but we have different ways of going about them. We bring different experiences. But we are contrasting on issues, compared to the Republicans who, I think, are contrasting on insults. And I think it's a better contest where we can take our ideas to groups like this throughout New Hampshire, get questions, have people vet them, and then let the voters make up their minds.
COOPER: You've talked about progressive values. Earlier in the day Senator Sanders was asked if you were progressive. He said some days. Are you really a progressive? In the past you have said you plead guilty to being a moderate.
CLINTON: Well, you know, you asked me this question in the first debate, right?
COOPER: I did. And it's coming up again today.
CLINTON: And I said that I'm a progressive who likes to get things done. And I was somewhat amused today that Senator Sanders has set himself up to be the gatekeeper on who is the progressive because under the definition that was flying around on Twitter and statements by the campaign, Barack Obama would not be a progressive, Joe Biden would not be a progressive, Jeanne Shaheen would not be a progressive, even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not be a progressive. So I'm not going to let that bother me. I know where I stand. I know who stands with me. I know what I've done. But I don't think it helps for the senator to be making those kinds of comparisons because clearly we all share a lot of the same hopes and aspirations for our country that we want to see achieved. And I don't think it's appropriate that, you know, if Planned Parenthood endorses me or the Human Rights Campaign endorses me, you know, they're thrown out of the progressive wing and put into the establishment. That's just not anything we need to do. Let's have a good contest of ideas. Let's contrast where we stand. And that's what I intend to do for the next couple of days.
COOPER: It would obviously be historic if you were elected president, first female president.
CLINTON: You think so? [laughter] [applause]
COOPER: I've studied a little bit of history. But it seems like young women aren't rallying to this potentially historic moment. And I say this in Iowa, among women under 30, Senator Sanders beat you by 70 points. Why do you think that is?
CLINTON: That's amazing. Yes. Look, you know, I was very fortunate to have a great team of young people, men and women, supporting me. But I accept the fact that I have work to do to convey what I stand for, what I've accomplished, what I want to do for young people in our country.
COOPER: Why do you think it is? That they're...
CLINTON: But I — well, you know, I don't really know, Anderson. I think — here's what I want young people to know. They don't have to be for me, I'm going to be for them. It doesn't really matter. [applause]
If they are not supporting me, I will be their president, I will do everything I can to give them the opportunities they deserve.
As I speak with young people across the country in Iowa, New Hampshire, and elsewhere, I do sense this real feeling of being somehow disadvantaged, put on the wrong side of American opportunity. And I understand that. I mean the student debt problems, the feeling that the jobs that are out there are not producing the kind of income or opportunity that young people believe they should be able to get. But at the same time I'm so impressed by the level, the intensity of commitment of this generation to you know really going after discrimination, going after racism and sexism and the kind of abuses that LGBT community members have, looking for ways to bring more justice in the economy and the environment, fighting climate change. So I'm impressed with them. And I'm going to do everything I can to reach out and to explain why good ideas on paper are important. But you've got to be able to translate them into action to get results for people. I have a lot experience doing that. I think I can deliver positive change for young people in our country. And I hope to have the chance to win their support.
COOPER: What's wrong with a revolution?
CLINTON: Well, that's for Sen. Sanders to explain because that certainly is the core of his message to young people. I have a different take on it. I think the progress that we have made, and particularly the Democratic Party has made, has been hard fought for, hard won and must be defended. So I want to defend the Affordable Care Act. It is one of the great accomplishments, not only of this president, but of the Democratic Party going back to Harry Truman. [applause] The Republicans are... [applause] You know, the Republicans are determined to repeal it. And they tried 62 times just to turn it back to the insurance companies. Sen. Sanders and I share the same goal. We want to get to universal health care coverage. Before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare, as you remember.
COOPER: I remember.
CLINTON: I fought really hard. The insurance companies and the drug companies spent millions against me. I know what it's like to go up against the status quo and special interests. So when President Obama succeeded, I was thrilled. I don't agree with Sen. Sanders that we should start over, that we should throw our country into a contentious national debate about health care again. We're at 90 percent coverage. I'm going to fix what needs to be fixed. We're going to move from 90 to 100, which is a lot easier to get to than starting at zero to get to 100. So we have a difference. And I think that... [applause] ... is the difference.
COOPER: I want you to meet some of the folks in our audience.
CLINTON: Sure.
COOPER: This is Dave Skinell. He's a high school English teacher from Manchester. He says he's undecided. David?
CLINTON: Hi, David.
QUESTION: Hi, Sec. Clinton. You — the next president will have as many as three Supreme Court appointments to make.
CLINTON: Right.
QUESTION: I'm wondering beyond abortion are there any issues on which you would impose or assert a litmus test. And if your answer is no, aren't certain critical issues like marriage equality, campaign finance just so vital to what we believe in as Democrats that you would have to know the answer as to how these justices would rule before you make the nomination?
CLINTON: Well, I'll tell you what, Dave. I do have a litmus test. I have a bunch of litmus tests because I agree with you. The next president could get as many as three appointments. You know one of the many reasons why we can't turn the White House over to the Republicans again is because of the Supreme Court. I'm looking for people who understand the way the real world works, who don't have a kneejerk reaction to support business, to support the idea that you know money is speech, that gutted the Voting Rights Act. I voted for the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act when I was in the Senate. It passed 98 to nothing based on a very extensive set of hearings and research. Supreme Court comes along. They substitute their judgment for the Congress, signed by George W. Bush. That is one of our problems. They have a view that I just fundamentally disagree with about what the way we have to keep the balance of power in our society is. So they have given way too much power to corporations. They have given Citizens United, the biggest gift to the Koch brothers, Karl Rove and all of those folks whose values I don't share, and who are doing everything they can to try to turn the clock back. We have to preserve marriage equality. We have to go further to end discrimination against the LGBT community... [applause] We've got to make sure... [applause] We've got to make sure to preserve Roe v. Wade, not let it be nibbled away or repealed.
We've got work to do... [applause] And here's how I think about it, because when I was a senator, I had to vote on Supreme Court justices. I'm looking for people who are rooted in the real world, who know that part of the genius of our system, both economic and government, is this balance of power. If it gets too far out of whack, so that business has too much power, any branch of the government has too much power, the delicate balance that makes up our political system and the broad-based prosperity we should be working for in our economy is the worse off for it. So I have very strong feelings about what I'll be looking for if I am given the honor of appointing somebody to the Supreme Court. [applause]
COOPER: OK. [applause]
I want you to meet Mr. Jim Kinhan. He's a Democrat who says he is supporting you.
JIM KINHAN: Hello, Madam Secretary.
CLINTON: Thank you.
KINHAN: I'm very pleased to see you. This may come a little bit from right field, this may seem, but it's very personal to me and resonates probably with many other people who are elderly dealing with health issues. The question is coming to me as a person who is walking with colon cancer. And I'm walking with colon cancer with the word terminal very much in my vocabulary, comfortably and spiritually. But I wonder what leadership you could offer within an executive role that might help advance the respectful conversation that is needed around this personal choice that people may make, as we age and deal with health issues or be the caregivers of those people, to help enhance and — their end of life with dignity.
CLINTON: Well, first of all, thank you for being here. Thank you so much for being part of this great New Hampshire primary process and thank you for support. And I really appreciate your asking the question. And I have to tell you, this is the first time I've been asked that question.
KINHAN: I — I figured that.
CLINTON: Yes. I — I really — I really...
KINHAN: Maybe any candidate.
CLINTON: And I thank you for it, because we need to have a conversation in our country. There are states, as you know...
KINHAN: Yes.
CLINTON: — that are moving to open up the opportunity without criminal liability for people to make this decision, in consultation by their families, even, in some cases, with medical professionals. But the issue is whether the medical professionals want to be involved or just be counselors. So it is a crucial issue that people deserve to understand from their own ethical, religious, faith-based perspective. So here's how I think about it. I want — I want, as president, to try to catalyze that debate because I — I believe you're right, this is going to become an issue more and more...
KINHAN: Exactly.
CLINTON: — often. We are, on the good side, having many people live longer, but often, then, with very serious illnesses that they can be sustained on, but at some point, don't want to continue with the challenges that poses. So I don't have any easy or glib answer for you. I think I would want to really immerse myself in the — the — the ethical writings, the health writings, the scientific writings, the religious writings. I know some other countries, the Netherlands and others, have a quite open approach. I'd like to know what their experience has been. Because we — we have to be sure that nobody is coerced, nobody is under duress. And that is a difficult line to draw. So I thank you — I thank you so much for raising this really important absolutely critical question that we're all going to have to do some thinking about.
KINHAN: Thank you [inaudible]. [applause]
COOPER: I think this is Michael Feel. Michael is a married father of one. He says he's undecided. He's learning — leaning toward Senator Sanders. Michael?
CLINTON: Hi, Michael.
MICHAEL FEEL: Hi, Secretary Clinton. As senator and as secretary of State, you have a history of interventionist foreign policy that is troubling to many Democratic voters, including myself. As a voter who is opposed to the United States being the world's policeman, can you assure me that as president, you would not expand our military involvement abroad?
CLINTON: No, I can't, Michael. I mean I — I'd like to be able to say I could, but here's what I can say. I have learned and have been, you know, really in the crucible of making a lot of hard decisions over the last years. And military force must always be a last resort not a first choice. That is one of the biggest differences between me and the Republicans.
I worked very hard as secretary of State to do what I could diplomatically to avoid conflict. That's why I worked to get the coalition together to impose sanctions in Iran, so that we could get them to the negotiating table, in order to test whether we could get an agreement to put a nuclear weapons agreement in place. I did that in large measure motivated by my deep concern that the absence of effective diplomacy might very well have sparked an arms race among some very unstable nations in the region, and maybe even led to conflict. I will do everything I possibly can to avoid sending American troops abroad, getting us involved in military conflicts. But I can't in good conscious stand here and tell you that there would never be any circumstances in the time that I served as President where it very well might be in America's best vital national security interest. So I want to be honest with you. I will do what I can, I will stand against adventurism, ill thought out missions. I will not send American combat troops to Iraq or Syria. That is off the table. That would be a terrible mistake. We will continue to use Special Forces, and we have to because of the kinds of threats we face. You know, the network of terrorist organizations — not just ISIS, but others who are part of this unfortunate network that stretches from North Africa to South Asia — pose serious threats to friends, allies, and partners, as well as to ourselves. And we've got to keep our country safe, and we have to work with the rest of the world to try to defeat ISIS, to end that terrorist threat. So I will be a very careful, deliberate decision maker when facing hard choices, because I know what's at stake. And I know you can understand why there can't be from me anyway a blanket statement. But I want to assure you I will be transparent, I will be open, and I will explain to the American people if any occasion arises where we do have to take military action to protect ourselves or our close friends and partners.
COOPER: I want to follow up the — yesterday on Capitol Hill the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Commander of the Marine Corps said that he thinks, and I quote, all eligible and qualified men and women should register for the draft, talking about Selective Service. Do you think women should also have to register for Selective Service, like men?
CLINTON: You know the first time I heard that yesterday and here's the reasoning, as best I, I understand from listening to the testimony excerpts. That, if we're going to open combat positions to qualified women so that they can compete to be Army Rangers, they can compete to be Navy Seals, they can compete to be Infantry Officers in the Marines, then we have expanded the definition of the all-volunteer military. I, I have to think about whether I think it's necessary to go as far as our military officers are recommending. You know, from my perspective, the all-volunteer military has worked, and we should not do anything that undermines it because it has provided a solid core of people who are willing to serve our country. The idea of having everybody register concerns me a little bit unless we have a better idea of where that's going to come out. Where I want people to register, I want every young person to register at the age of 18 to be able to vote automatically, and I think if — if we had, you know, if we had a system like that I would, I would be very, very pleased about it. I have a hard time imagining the kind of national emergency that would require the use of the Selective Service system. So I just have to be better informed about why they're making this recommendation.
COOPER: I want you to meet Rebecca Hutchinson. She's a former State Representative in New Hampshire. She says she's undecided and she's got a question for you.
CLINTON: Hi, Rebecca.
REBECCA HUTCHINSON: Thank you. I feel in a way I sort of have a follow-up to the previous question. You clearly have very impressive foreign policy experience, and I've heard you point out to us that President Obama chose you and trusted you to be his Secretary of State. But I get stuck when I think about you voted for the Iraq war, which you now say was a mistake. What have you learned since that vote that could give me confidence that you wouldn't make a mistake of that magnitude again?
CLINTON: Oh, I think that's a very fair question. You know, I did make a mistake and I admitted that I made a mistake. And in large measure that mistake really arose from the Bush administration's approach to what they thought they could accomplish in Iraq. The very explicit appeal that President Bush made before announcing the invasion that getting that vote would be a strong piece of leverage in order to finish the inspections. And he made that comment. And the U.N. Inspector Hans Blix said, give us the time, we will find out. Give us the hammer over their head, namely the vote, and we will be able to find out what they still have in terms of WMD. And the Bush administration didn't give them the time. And that was a breach of faith, in my view. But you know I gave them the vote, in large measure because I thought that would give us the time and we would find out, short of invasion. Turned out not to be. And I really regret that that's the way President Bush proceeded. That would not be something you would have to worry about with me. If I tell you we're going to do diplomacy, we're going to hang tough, we're going to get answers, that's exactly what we will do.
COOPER: I want you to meet Sean Burke. He's a Democrat from Derry, says he is a supporter of yours. Sean?
CLINTON: Hi, Sean.
QUESTION: Hey. Once you become the nominee and got elected, how are you going to defend yourself against right-wing attacks?
CLINTON: Well, Sean, I had a lot of practice. [laughter and applause] So I could laugh up here, but it's not easy. It is a brutal experience. And when it first started happening to me back in the early 1990s when I was working on health care. And you know I was just unrecognizable to myself. What talk radio was saying, what Republican members of Congress and their allies were saying. I was just stunned. I could not understand how they got away with it. And I have had to learn to take criticism seriously, but not personally. And by that I mean this. The very fair question from Rebecca. People ask you questions or criticize you, think about it seriously. There are lessons to be learned, often from people who don't agree with you. But don't take it personally so that it just paralyzes you, literally stops you in your tracks. And so now that I've been through this for so many years, Sean, my understanding of the political tactics that the other side uses is pretty well versed. They play to keep. They play to destroy. They are constantly doing whatever they can to win. And they have a history now going back, you know, 35-36 years of going after people who they believe they can't otherwise stop unless they engage in that negative attack. So right now, for example, a couple of hedge fund billionaires have started a super PAC to run ads against me. Karl Rove has you know solicited money from Wall Street to run ads against me. I view that as perversely flattering because clearly they know I mean what I say and I will do what I say. And I will stand in their way and I will stop them from perpetuating an agenda on America that is bad for our democracy, bad for our economy, bad for our societies. So I know I have to keep defending against them. But I'm the one who has the experience to do that. It's unlike anything you've ever gone through to be the subject of tens of millions of dollars of untrue, terrible attacks. And now the Koch brothers say they're going to spend $750 million to defeat the Democratic nominee. I'm still standing, and I will be standing. So don't worry about that. [applause]
COOPER: Let me just simply follow up. You mentioned attacks on the early 1990s.
CLINTON: Right.
COOPER: Do you still believe there's a vast right-wing conspiracy?
CLINTON: Don't you? [laughter]
COOPER: I'm asking you.
CLINTON: Yes. It's gotten even better funded. You know they brought in some new multibillionaires to pump the money in.
And look, these guys play for keeps. They want to control our country. Senator Sanders and I agree on that completely. They want to rig the economy so they continue to get richer and richer, they could care less about income inequality. They salve their consciences by giving big money to philanthropy, and, you know, getting great pictures of them standing in front of whatever charity they donated to. But make no mistake, they want to destroy unions. They want to go after any economic interests that they don't believe they can control. They want to destroy our balance of power. They want to go after our political system and fill it with people who will do their bidding. I said today in Dover, you know, I don't think all of the Republican candidates are so ill-informed about climate change that they say they don't know because they're not scientists. They're just doing the bidding of the Koch brothers. They're told don't you dare say climate change is real because we're in the fossil fuel business. So this is exactly what they are up to. And, yes... [applause] ... it is probably — look, at this point it's probably not correct to say it's a conspiracy because it's out in the open. You know, there is no doubt about what they're doing and who the players are and what they're trying to achieve. And they're shopping among the Republican candidates to figure out who among them will most likely do their bidding. So just know what we're up against because it's real and we're going to beat it. But it's going to take everybody working together. [applause]
COOPER: I want you to meet Alison Pyott. She's an independent torn between you and Senator Sanders.
CLINTON: Hi, Alison.
ALISON PYOTT: I'm sensing a theme here. First, thank you so much for all you've done for our country and for women.
CLINTON: Thank you.
PYOTT: My question is the number of factors, some you have just described, have eroded trust in you. What will you do to regain that trust, engender trust in Americans and me?
CLINTON: Well, thank you for starting by saying it's related to what I just said. And I acknowledge this as personally painful as it is. When you have been subjected to the level, the velocity of attacks that come every day, even if there is no factual basis to it, it's just normal for people to say, gosh, there has got to be something, why do they keep saying this and then we do that. And, you know, I testify for 11 hours, there's nothing to Benghazi, they don't give it up, they keep coming after it. So I know that I have to really demonstrate as clearly as I can who I am, what I stand for, and what I've always done. I've always been guided by the same values. I have always listened to people. And I've always worked as hard as I could to produce results for people. So when I ran for the Senate the first time and I was out there and, you know, people were barraging, I was running first against Rudy Giuliani and all of that. And I was able to just keep going and tell people, here's who I am, here's what I do, I want to do this with you. And I won. And then since years later when I ran, I got a higher percentage. And then I did have, as you all remember, a really tough campaign against then-Senator Obama. We saw each other very up close and personal. And he wins and turns and asks me to be his secretary of state, because he trusts me, he trusts my judgment, he trusts my experience. So all I can do is to just get up every day and work to do what I believe our country needs, find ways to help people, whether it's on mental health or addiction or autism or student loans, whatever it might be. And I trust the American people. I trust the people of New Hampshire to see my lifetime of work and service and to sort out all of the static and to know that I will work my heart out for you. And that's what I hope you will understand. [applause]
COOPER: I want to welcome Rabbi Jonathan Spira-Savett. He's an independent, says he's undecided about his vote. Rabbi?
CLINTON: Hello, Rabbi.
RABBI JONATHAN SPIRA-SAVETT: Hello. Another rabbi, Rabbi Simcha Bunem taught that every person has to have two pockets and in each pocket they have to carry a different note. And the note in one pocket says the universe was created for me. And in the other pocket the note says I am just dust and ashes. And I want you to take a moment and think about what you would tell us about your two pockets.
How do you cultivate the ego, the ego that we all know you must have, a person must have to be the leader of the free world, and also the humility to recognize that we know that you can't be expected to be wise about all the things that the president has to be responsible for?
CLINTON: Another absolutely wonderful question. Thank you, Rabbi. I think about this a lot. Um, I feel very fortunate that I am a person of faith, that I was raised in my church and that I have had to deal and struggle with a lot of these issues about ambition and humility, about service and self-gratification, all of the human questions that all of us deal with, but when you put yourself out into the public arena, I think it's incumbent upon you to be as self- conscious as possible. This is hard for me. You know, I never thought I'd be standing on a stage here asking people to vote for me for president. I always wanted to be of service. I met my husband, who was such a natural, knew exactly what he wanted to do. I was happy to support him while I worked in the Children's Defense Fund and legal services and taught law, and, you know, had our daughter. I never thought I would do this. And so I have had to come to grips with how much more difficult it often is for me to talk about myself than to talk about what I want to do for other people, or to tell stories about, you know, the man I met in Rochester who — whose AIDS medicine is no longer affordable. And that — that can grip me and make me feel like there's something I can do about that. So I'm constantly trying to balance how do I assume the mantle of a position as essentially august as president of the United States not lose track of who I am, what I believe in and what I want to do to serve? I have that dialogue at least, you know, once a day in some setting or another. And I don't know that there is any ever absolute answer, like, OK, universe, here I am, watch me roar or oh, my gosh, I can't do it, it's just overwhelming, I have to retreat. It's that balance that I keep to try to find in my life that I want to see back in our country. And it will be something that I continue to talk about with a — you know, with a group of faith advisers who are close to me. I get a scripture lesson every morning from a minister that I have a really close personal relationship with. And, you know, it just gets me grounded. He gets up really early to send it to me. So, you know, there it is in my in box at 5:00 a.m.. I have friends who are rabbis who send me notes, give me readings that are going to be discussed in services. So I really appreciate all that incoming. And the final thing I would say, because again, it's not anything I've ever talked about this much publicly, everybody knows I — I have lived a very public life for the last 25 or so years. And so I've had to be in public dealing with some very difficult issues and personal issues, political, public issues. And I read a, um, a treatment of the prodigal son parable by the Jesuit Henri Nouwen, who I think is a magnificent writer of spiritual and theological concerns. And I — I read that parable and there was a line in it that became just a lifeline for me. And it basically is practice the discipline of gratitude. So regardless of how hard the days are, how difficult the decisions are, be grateful. Be grateful for being a human being, being part of the universe. Be grateful for your limitations. Know that you have to reach out to have more people be with you, to support you, to advise you, listen to your critics, answer the questions. But at the end, be grateful. Practice the discipline of gratitude. And that has helped me enormously. [applause]
COOPER: We're going to have more questions from the audience for Secretary Clinton when we come back.
We'll take a short break.
[commercial break]
COOPER: Welcome back to CNN's Democratic Presidential Town Hall at the Derry Opera House in New Hampshire. We are here with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. I want to play a piece of video...
CLINTON: OK.
COOPER: ...from Senator Sanders the other night in Iowa after the votes came in, and get you to respond.
CLINTON: OK.
[begin video clip]
SANDERS: We do not represent the interests of the billionaire class, Wall Street, or corporate America. We don't want their money. We will... And I am very proud to tell you that we are the only candidate on the Democratic side without a Super PAC. And the reason that we have done so well here in Iowa, the reason I believe we're going to do so well in New Hampshire, and in the other states that follow, the reason is the American people are saying no to a rigged economy.
[end video clip]
COOPER: We got a number of questions, even from people who support your policies, who say they do believe that you represent the interests of Wall Street and corporate America. How do you respond?
CLINTON: Well, look, that's just not the case. And I did represent New York, obviously.
There was no doubt that I took on a lot of what was going down on Wall Street, including calling them out on the mortgage issues, calling for a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau even before we got one created, calling for changes in CEO pay. But I honestly think that the best answer to this is the fact that everybody that I know who looks at what's happening in this campaign sees the same thing. The Wall Street interests, the money interests, the Republican political interests are spending a lot of money to try to defeat me. So I just find it kind of a strange argument. I happen to agree with Sen. Sanders. I'm not just going after Wall Street though. I think that's too narrow a target. I think we need to go after a company like Johnson Controls that is trying to avoid paying taxes after all of us bailed it out by pretending to sell itself in a so-called inversion in Europe. It's a perversion. It should be stopped. I want to go after the hedge funds that have bought up drug companies, you know Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Turing Pharmaceuticals, taking drugs that have been around a long time and upping the price. So I take seriously the obligation that I would have as president once again to try to get the deck un-stacked, to get the odds favoring the average American again... [applause] And but I just have to — I have to respectfully say, I think Sen. Sanders' target is too small, I really do. You know I respect him going after the big banks. I agree with him. No bank is too big to fail. No executive to powerful to jail. But we actually passed the process to be able to take on banks that pose excessive risk in our financial system in Dodd-Frank. So let's know the next president has to implement, but doesn't have to achieve that. Here's what I want to do. I want to go after all the other culprits. It wasn't just the big banks. It was the insurance company AIG. It was the investment bank Lehman Brothers. It was Countrywide Mortgage. It was Wachovia. There were a lot of bad actors. And if all you do is look over here, I'm telling you, they're going to be over there in the shadow banking sector just cooking up all kinds of ways to once again put our economy at risk. So I've got no argument that we need to take on these vested interests. I just have a wider group that I think we need to go after, from pharmaceuticals... [applause] ... insurance companies, shadow banking and other corporations that I think are undermining our ecoomy. And frankly they are undermining our democracy. This Johnson Controls thing really infuriates me. We bailed them out. The Republicans wanted the auto industry to just fail. They didn't care about the millions of jobs. Barack Obama and the Democratic Congress gave them a bailout. It turned out to be a good deal. All of us paid for it. They paid back the Treasury. So we didn't lose any money and we saved millions of jobs. And the auto industry just had a great year. Johnson Controls was one of those begging for the bailout. And now they're not going to pay their taxes? We're going to go right after that. That is absolutely wrong. [applause] And we need to be focused on getting a fix for that. [applause]
COOPER: One of the things... [applause] One of the things that Sen. Sanders points to and a lot of your critics point to is you made three speeches for Goldman Sachs. You were paid $675,000 for three speeches. Was that a mistake? I mean was that a bad error in judgment?
CLINTON: Look. I made speeches to lots of groups. I told them what I thought. I answered questions.
COOPER: But did you have to be paid $675,000?
CLINTON: Well, I don't know. That's what they offered, so...[laughter] You know every secretary of State that I know has done that.
COOPER: But [inaudible] for office they're not running for an office...
CLINTON: Well, I didn't know...
COOPER: ... have known.
CLINTON: To be honest I wasn't — I wasn't committed to running. I didn't know whether I would or not.
COOPER: You didn't think you were going to run for president again?
CLINTON: I didn't. You know when I was secretary of State several times I said you know I think I'm done. And you know, so many people came to me, started talking to me. The circumstances, the concerns I had about the Republicans taking back the White House, because I think they wrecked what we achieved in the 1990s with 23 million new jobs and incomes going up for everybody. I did not want to see that happen again. I want to defend President Obama's accomplishments and the progress we've made. I want to go further. So yes, I was convinced. But you know anybody who knows me who thinks that they can influence me, name anything they've influenced me on. Just name one thing. I'm out here every day saying I'm going to shut them down, I'm going after them. I'm going to jail them if they should be jailed. I'm going to break them up. I mean they're not giving me very much money now. I can tell you that much. [laughter] Fine with me.
I'm proud to have 90 percent of my donations from small donors and 60 percent, the highest ever, from women, which I'm really, really glad about. [applause]
COOPER: So just to be clear, that's not something you regret, those three speeches, that money?
CLINTON: No, I don't, because, you know, I don't feel that I paid any price for it and I am very clear about what I will do and they're on notice.
COOPER: I want to see if Chris Lopez is here. Chris, there you are. Chris is an independent with a question for Secretary Clinton. She says she's undecided, I should point out. Chris?
CLINTON: Hi, Chris.
CHRIS LOPEZ: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I see a lot of hypocrisy in this country when I have a really hard time getting the medicine I need and yet it's really easy to get alcohol. What will you do to decriminalize marijuana so people — so I and people like me can get the pain and spasm relief that we need?
CLINTON: I will do a lot, Chris, because we have an opportunity to do much more with respect to research into marijuana, what it can do to help people with the kinds of conditions you've just briefly described. I want to move it from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule II so that we can begin to do more research. The NIH and a lot of universities can begin to try to find out. Because I want you to know what we know from science. But I also want you to be able to use it while we're doing the research. And so many states, as you know, have moved to provide legal protection for the use of medical marijuana. I support that. I think that the states are the laboratories of our democracy. We should be learning about what works, what doesn't work. Different states have actually listed the kind of illnesses and conditions that it can be used for. Are they right? We don't know. That's why we have got to do the research. I also want you to know what dosage is right, what interacts with the other medication you're taking. I want to accelerate this because I have no doubt that there are very real benefits for people. We know in chemotherapy, we know from other conditions in using the right amount of the right kind of marijuana. I just want to make sure it's the right amount and the right kind. That's why I want to get that research up and going as quickly as possible. But you said something else which I think is really important. We can't be here in New Hampshire and not talk about the addiction problem in New Hampshire. Not talk about the fact that there have been more deaths by overdoses than car crashes in this state. Not talk about the lives that are being destroyed, the people that I meet, the grandmothers raising their grandchildren because they've lost their children. I just left a rally in Manchester, and a woman grabbed my hand and she said, I just lost my son to an overdose. So I have been working with elected officials like Senator Shaheen, like Governor Hassan, like Governor Shumlin of Vermont, who supports me, to try to figure out how do we put together a new approach, a new law enforcement approach so that first-time, low-level drug users are not sent to jail but instead we have more treatment and recovery programs? There are 23 million people who need help in our country, both alcohol and drugs. There are 10 percent of the kind of spaces that they need to take care of those people. So we've got to work on law enforcement. We have to work on doctors to understand better when they prescribe opioids, which is often the first step towards heroin. We have to have every police department equipped with naloxone, which is the antidote to reverse overdose, save lives here in New Hampshire. We've got to put more money into this. So all of this to me fits together. You deserve answers about marijuana and we deserve more treatment for people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol for other kinds of challenges. So that's what I would like to do. [applause]
COOPER: I want you to meet — this is Julie Carnigan, she's from Windham. Julie?
CLINTON: Hi.
JULIE CARNIGAN: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I'm the proud mother of five girls, two of my own, three step- daughters. And unfortunately they are all ""feeling the Bern."" And I would like to know what you would do to convince them to vote for you.
CLINTON: How old are they?
CARNIGAN: They're in their — 21, 22, and a couple of 23s and a 25-year-old. [laughter]
CLINTON: Well, first of all, tell them I'm glad they're interested in politics, and I really mean that. I want them to be involved. I want them to feel like I felt when I was that age, some years ago, and getting excited and interested in politics for the first time.
I also want them to take a look at my record, what I have done my entire life, starting as a young lawyer working for the Children's Defense Fund, taking on the problem of juveniles incarcerated with adults in South Carolina, trying to gather information to end segregated academies in the South. I want them to know that I was a legal services lawyers, standing up for equality under the law, defending people's rights because I believe passionately that those of us who have the opportunity to serve should serve. And then I hope they will look at what I have accomplished from, you know, starting the Children's Health Insurance Program that insures eight million kids, looking at ways to try to be smart in reforming our adoption and foster care system, with very partisan Republicans when I was First Lady. Getting healthcare for our National Guard. Helping to negotiate and implement a treaty to reduce nuclear weapons. A long list. And the reason I say that is I think it's very important that, as people move toward the primary on Tuesday, whatever your age, you really think about what someone is proposing and what their record is about getting it done. And as I've said and I mean it absolutely, I have the highest respect for Senator Sanders. But as the ""Concord Monitor"" said today in its writing about this, you know, it's, it's very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable. So I don't want to over promise. We've got too much of that. I want to tell people what I will do. I want to be specific because I do want to — to go back to the question I was asked earlier — recreate the trust that seems to have been splintered in America. We need to set big goals again. I am all for that. I have big, ambitious goals. Affordable college, early childhood education, making sure that we are on the path to paid family leave, all of which will help your daughters. But I also want them to hold me accountable. I want them to say, OK, how's that actually going to happen? What do we have to do to make it? We've got to get 60 votes to break a filibuster in the Senate. Nancy Pelosi has said, we're not going to revisit healthcare. We're going to stick with the Affordable Care Act. That's exactly where I am. We're going to improve it. Because I am somebody who wants to actually produce a real difference in people's lives. I am a progressive who gets results. And I will be a progressive President who gets results. And the final thing I would say is, it is still the case that there are challenges and obstacles to young women's ambitions. And I'm going to try to break the highest and hardest glass ceiling. I hope it splinters completely and, and I hope for your daughters it opens doors that might not be open right now, regardless of whether any of them ever do any politically. But in their lives, their profession, how they're treated. I hope it does give them more of a sense of empowerment. That's what I want for my daughter and my amazing granddaughter, and that's what I want for your daughters.
COOPER: [inaudible]. Just as we did with Senator Sanders, we've talked about a lot of important policy issues. I just want to ask kind of a couple of personal questions just for voters to get...
CLINTON: You don't think they know everything?
COOPER: Well, I don't know. We'll see about that. It's interesting to me, I mean you have — as you said, you have been one of the most famous women in the world now for, for decades. You have no anonymity. If you could be anonymous for just one day, what would you do?
CLINTON: I used to do this in the White House and, you know, I would, I would put on a baseball cap and sunglasses and, you know, sweat pants and a sweat shirt, and put my hair back, and I would go walk. And I would tell the Secret Service they had to wear casual clothes, they had to take the things out of their ears, they had to look like they were just tourists. I had the best time, you know. I would, I would end up over on the Mall sometimes, walking around. And a family would come up and say, would you mind taking our picture in front of the White House. I'd be happy to. Here, why don't you... So, you know, there's nothing I like better than to be anonymous, as hard as that is to achieve. So I would spend the day, you know, out in nature, talking a long walk, walking through one of the beautiful towns here in New Hampshire, stopping in a cafe, stopping in a bookstore. You know, maybe calling some of my friends, some of whom are here tonight, and say, don't tell anybody but meet me, you know, there. That's what I, that's what I want to do, and it's what I get the great joy out of. I am so fortunate that I still have my friends from grade school and every other phase of my life. And they keep me grounded, they keep me honest, they deflate my head, they deal with the universe in one pocket and the dust and ashes in the other. [laughter]
So any time I get to spend time with them. And then of course it would have to end with seeing my granddaughter because that's the creme de le resistance...
COOPER: What does she call you?
CLINTON: She calls me grandma. Grandma. Yes. She's working really hard on words. And it was so thrilling. They came to Iowa that last weekend because we obviously weren't going to leave. And so they got in late the night, Saturday night. And Sunday morning I'm getting ready. And you know Bill and I are you know having coffee and everything. So Chelsea brings her in and she sees me. She goes ""grandma"". And honest to goodness, the caucus could've ended right there. I would've been perfectly happy... [applause] ... saying the best thing has happened to me right this minute in Iowa. So that's where I'd end my day.
COOPER: You talked about the circle of friends you have. Obviously in 2011 your mom passed away.
CLINTON: Right.
COOPER: In 2008 she was part of your campaign.
CLINTON: She was.
COOPER: And you wrote about how at the end of the day you would, you know, sit around the kitchen table with her, kick off your shoes and just talk about everything that had happened.
CLINTON: Right.
COOPER: What do you think — what advice do you think she would give you today in this campaign in this year?
CLINTON: You know, my mother truly is my inspiration because she had such a terrible, miserable life and was abandoned and rejected by her own family, and was out at the age of 14 working as a housemaid. And her resilience, her love, her ability to have her own family to take such good care of us was just, you know to me the ultimate accomplishment in any life. And she would always give me the advice she gave me as a little girl. You know you get knocked down. Everybody gets knocked down. What matters is whether you get up. And when you get up, what do you do? How do you behave? Are you going to be bitter? Angry? Upset? Are you going to try to be positive, get something done, help somebody else? And I'm sure that's exactly what she'd be saying now. She'd be encouraging me. She'd be very proud, a little apprehensive because you know it's a brutal business being in politics. And people say things about those you love, whether it's your daughter or someone else. So she was very supportive. But you could tell you know how much pain she kind of absorbed from time to time. And so I would sit with her and I would say don't listen to that stuff, mom. And she'd say, well I have to know what they're saying about you. And I'd say you know don't put yourself through that. And so that would be what she'd be doing now I think too. Yes.
COOPER: I want you to be able to make your closing argument...
CLINTON: Oh.
COOPER: ... to the people in New Hampshire.
CLINTON: Well, thank you. Well, first of all, thanks again for being part of this process, this first in the nation primary. You know I said earlier today some people said well you know Sen. Sanders is ahead. And I respect that. And so maybe you know I should go onto the next state. And I said absolutely not. New Hampshire has been so good to me and my family. And I love campaigning in New Hampshire. I love this process. So, you're going to have to put up with me. I'm going to be going around the state, going to as many events as I can, answering as many questions, trying to talk about what I am offering. I really believe that we have a chance to build on the progress we've made and to get results for people. To get the economy producing more good jobs, to get incomes rising again, that's my goal. I will not raise middle class taxes because the middle class hasn't even yet recovered from the Great Recession. We're going to stick with the Affordable Care Act. We're going to make it work. We're going to get early childhood education, affordable college and pay down student debt, a lot of the agenda that is important to our country, particularly to young people. And we're going to defend our rights. We're going to defend a woman's right to make her own health care decisions. [applause] We're going to defend Planned Parenthood. We're going to defend marriage equality and end discrimination against LGBT Americans. And we're going to take on the gun lobby because it is absolutely unconscionable to have... [applause] ... 33,000 people a year die from gun violence. [applause] So please, join me in this campaign. I hope you will come out and vote for me on Tuesday. And I will fight for you every single day in the White House. Thank you all very much. [cheers and applause]
COOPER: I want to thank both candidates for coming tonight, the voters for being here and asking such amazing questions... [applause] And the viewers at home. I also want to thank everybody with the Derry Opera House for their hospitality...[cheers] With the New Hampshire primaries now just days away, a reminder we'll be here for it all with [inaudible] expert analysis... [applause] Our coverage continues with Don Lemon right after this. [cheers] Thanks again.
CLINTON: Thank you all. [applause] Thank you, guys. [applause]

She joins us now from Manchester, as well. Madam Secretary, thank you for joining us this morning. So you have had your own turn on ""Saturday Night Live."" How did he do?
CLINTON: Well, I didn't get to see it, but it's always a fun experience. I'm sure he did great. You know, it's a wonderful forum. It's a crash course in trying to figure out how to do live TV. And I had a great time doing it.
STEPHANOPOULOS: We also had, of course, the Republican debate last night here at St. Anselm's. And Marco Rubio called you out on the issue of abortion. Take a look.
[begin video clip]
MARCO RUBIO: Why doesn't the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child? Why don't they ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that partial birth abortion, which is a gruesome procedure that has been outlawed in this country, she thinks that's a fundamental right. They are the extremists when it comes to the issue of abortion and I can't wait to expose them in a general election.
[end video clip]
STEPHANOPOULOS: Are you going to get exposed in a general election?
CLINTON: You know, George, I — it's really quite sad to see what Senator Rubio is becoming in this campaign. Everybody understands that he is diving as far right as he possibly can. You know, I've been on record for many years about where I stand on abortion, how it should be safe and legal and I have the same position that I've had for a very long time. But what's really going on here is an effort by the Republicans to keep pushing as far as they can to overturn ""Roe v. Wade,"" to defund Planned Parenthood, to make accusations and attacks that are really extreme...
STEPHANOPOULOS: But are there any...
CLINTON: — and I — I think the Amer...
STEPHANOPOULOS: — restrictions you would accept on late-term abortions?
CLINTON: Well, you know, I've been on the record on this for a long time. You know, I think that the life and health of the mother, obviously, rape and incest, have to be always taken into account. And, you know, when he raises the, you know, very, very difficult issue of late-term abortion, he conveniently overlooks the fact that there are medical reasons, there are health-related reasons. I've met women who have had to face this excruciating choice. This is not something that anyone that I've ever met with enters into without the deepest thought, the most careful consideration. And I remember at an event back in the '90s, where, you know, we sat and talked with some of the women who had to make a very hard decision. You know, it's — it's just so unfortunate that politicians like Senator Rubio are trying to politicize these kinds of very difficult concerns.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You...
CLINTON: And I don't think he should be allowed to get away with that.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You had your own debate with Bernie Sanders this week, as well. And he challenged — you challenged him to come up with evidence that contributions from Wall Street ever influenced your positions. He and his team have circulated the charge from Elizabeth Warren, who said you changed your position on the bankruptcy bill back in 2001 because of contributions. Here's what Senator Warren had to say.
[begin video clip]
ELIZABETH WARREN: One of the first bills that came up after she was Senator Clinton was the bankruptcy bill.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And?
WARREN: She voted in favor of it. She has taken money from the groups. And more to the point, she worries about them as a constituency.
[end video clip]
STEPHANOPOULOS: How do you respond to that charge?
CLINTON: Well, I'm glad you asked me about it, because this is one of these, you know, innuendo insinuation charges that the Sanders campaign is engaging in.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, that was Senator Warren, though.
CLINTON: If you — no, but — but I know. But if you had played the entire quote, you know, what you would have heard her say, she and I worked together in 2000 to stop a bankruptcy bill that we both believed was very harmful. When I got to the Senate in 2001, one of the first big votes there was on a version of the bankruptcy bill and I was deluged by women's groups and children's advocates groups to do everything I could to make sure that child support and women's precarious financial situation in case of divorce or not being able to get the kind of funding they needed from a partner or a spouse in bankruptcy would not be endangered. And it was. The current — that bill was making it a very low priority. So I did go to work on behalf of all these women's groups and children's groups because they needed a champion. And I got that bill changed. And in return, it had nothing to do with any money whatsoever — and I resent deeply any effort by the Sanders campaign to so imply...
STEPHANOPOULOS: But...
CLINTON: It had to do with trying to get a deal...
STEPHANOPOULOS: But that's not what...
CLINTON: — that would protect women. But now let me finish, George, because this has been bandied about and I just want to set the record straight. And so then three years later, part of the — part of what Senator — Senator Warren said, you played. You didn't play the whole thing, because we've been allies. I faced a tough decision and I stood up for women and children. I went to the Senate floor, said that was exactly what I was doing. Then the bill did not pass. It never became law. And then when the next bill came up, 2005, women's issues were taken care of because I had made that a point back in 2001. And so then I was against that bill. I didn't get a chance to actually vote against it because Bill was in the hospital having a heart procedure. But I put a statement out. I was against it. So I'm happy to set this record straight. And I really want to, once again, call out the Sanders campaign, which claims they like to run a positive campaign. But they have been quite artful in raising questions and trying to cast doubts about my record. And I really am not going to sit and take it anymore —
STEPHANOPOULOS: But Senator —
CLINTON: I have a public record. I have never, ever been influenced in a view or a vote by anyone who has given me any kind of money. So I'm just going to keep setting the record straight.
STEPHANOPOULOS: But in her book, Senator Warren said the bill was essentially the same but Hillary Clinton — Hillary Rodham Clinton was not. Big banks were now part of Secretary Clinton's consistency. She wanted their support. They wanted hers, including —
CLINTON: George, look, I — look, I have the greatest — I have the greatest respect for Senator Warren. As I said, we did work together. I faced a choice. I could have said to the women who have been my advocates for 30 years, I'm sorry; I'm now in the Senate. But you know, I can't help you. Nobody else is helping them. They were desperate to get help. They were afraid that child support was going to be below credit card debt, that they were going to be really left out and left behind and badly damaged. I could have said, you know, I can't do that because somebody in 10 years might say that, you know, something else is going on. That's not the way I work. So they came to me; I said this is outrageous. I went to the floor. I lobbied to get a change. And as part of getting that change from both Democrats and Republicans, who were leading that legislation, they said if we change this bill at the last minute to take account of these issues you're raising about women and children, which they had not clearly made a priority before I showed up, then you know, you have to say you'll vote for it. It was — you know, look, that's what you have to do. I swallowed hard; I said OK. But it was also the case it didn't get passed. So I got what I needed into the bill. It stayed in the bill, even in the bad version that I posed in 2005. So thanks for the opportunity to set the record straight.
STEPHANOPOULOS: In the debate the other night, you said you'd look into whether or not to release the transcripts of your speeches to financial groups. Have you made up your mind?
CLINTON: Yes, you know, here's another thing I want to say. Let everybody who's ever given a speech to any private group under any circumstances release them. We'll all release them at the same time. You know, I don't mind being the subject in Republican debates, the subject in the Democratic primary. That kind of goes with the territory. I've been around long enough. But at some point, you know, these rules need to apply to everybody. And there are a bunch of folks, including, you know, my opponent, who's given, you know, speeches to groups and people on the other side who've given speeches to groups. Let — if this is now going to be a new standard so then it should apply to everybody and then I'll be happy to look into it further.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Madam Secretary, thanks very much for your time this morning.
CLINTON: Great to talk to you, George, thanks.

42,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5000,"February 7, 2016","Interview with John Dickerson of CBS News ""Face the Nation""",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111587,Hillary Clinton,"DICKERSON: We begin with campaign 2016 and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is fighting to close a double-digit gap in the polls behind Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire. She joins us from Manchester. Secretary Clinton, your name came up, not surprisingly, in the Republican debate. [laughter]
Senator Marco Rubio claimed that on the question of abortion that you support abortion on baby's due date. What do you say to that?
CLINTON: Well, I think it's pretty pathetic, John. This is something that illustrates how Senator Rubio has been just going as far as he can to try to, I guess, buttress his credentials with certain parts of the Republican constituency. I have been on record for years about where I stand on making abortion safe and legal, the exceptions that are appropriate, that should be looked into, and the very difficult choices that very few women have to confront that lead to excruciating kinds of decisions. And to begin to politicize this so early in the campaign season, to try to raise the false charges and look like he's going to try to make sure Roe v. Wade is overturned and Planned Parenthood is defunded is just a tried-and-true tactic by those on the right.
DICKERSON: His charge here, though, is in terms of late-term abortions, that you talk about medical issues, but there are nonmedical abortions, he would say, and others who share his view would say, and that you're not having any restrictions on those who would choose to have an abortion for nonmedical reasons puts you on the extreme side of this.
CLINTON: Well, it's just not true. People should go back read Roe v. Wade. Reasonable kinds of restrictions can be imposed as long as the life and health of the mother are taken into account, and that is what the law is today. And I remember very well having a lot of incredibly difficult conversations listening to women who were told something devastating toward the end of their pregnancy, who were facing horrible kinds of consequences to their health and even potentially to their life. That's why this has to be taken into account by each individual woman, by her physician and her family. But, of course, under Roe v. Wade, there are certain guidelines. And Senator Rubio should know that, or I hope he does now.
DICKERSON: In the town hall the other night, you said that the financial interests — quote — ""are not giving me very much money now."" But according to ""The Washington Post"" analysis, donors of hedge funds, banks, insurance companies and other financial service firms have given you at least $21.4 million. That's about 10 percent of what you have raised. That seems like a lot of money.
CLINTON: Well, that's just not the calculation that we have done. But that's somebody's analysis. I'm not going to argue with it. What's really going on here, John, is disturbing to me. I will be really frank with you. What the Sanders campaign is trying to do is link donations to my political campaign or really donations to anyone's political campaign with undue influence, with changing people's views and votes. I have never, ever done that. And I really do resent the implication, or, as I said the other night, the insinuation. It would be like saying that President Obama, who took probably more money from Wall Street than any Democrat certainly had in 2008 with his successful campaign, was therefore automatically disqualified. Well, in fact, we know that was not true. He signed the toughest financial regulations since the 1930s with the Dodd-Frank bill. This is a very artful smear. And I'm just not going to sit and take it anymore.
DICKERSON: Are you saying, though, on these questions that people from the financial services industry have no greater access to you than anybody else?
CLINTON: I'm saying that I am available to and open to listening to people from all walks of life. I always have been. I always will be. But talk to the — if people want to donate to me from whatever industry, they know where I stand. They know that I called them out on the mortgage market mess back in — before the great crash happened. And I always like to remind people, it was not me, it was Senator Sanders who voted to deregulate slots and derivatives, which gave Lehman Brothers a lot of extra leverage, which was one of the contributing factors to their collapse, which obviously contributed to what happened in the great recession. So, we can take these step by step and try to unwind them, but it doesn't change the basic facts. People know where I stand. I rolled out the toughest, most effective effort to rein in financial abuse of anybody in this campaign. And it goes much further than Dodd-Frank. It goes much further than restoring Glass-Steagall, a 1930s efforts. It goes into shadow banking. It goes after hedge funds. It goes after carried interest loophole. Now, that is full disclosure. I am on the record. If somebody in one of these firms wants to give me money, I hope they know they're giving money to someone who is going to make sure they never wreck the economy again.
DICKERSON: In the debate, you also said — quote — ""Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment.""
CLINTON: Right.
DICKERSON: But isn't the experience you're — the experience you're running on gained through years of working in Democratic politics, doesn't that put you in the establishment, all that experience?
CLINTON: Well, I don't know. Senator Sanders has lot more time in elective office than I do. And I find that sort of an amusing contrast. He's been elected official for 25 years, far longer than I was. I think I bring a great mix of experience. And I think being a woman is a big part of how I see problems, how I think about solving problems, what I believe is absolutely foundational, starting with children and their lives and their opportunities. On my way to Flint today to go and meet with the mayor, who asked me to come because she wants to keep the national spotlight on what happened to the children in her community. And I commend her for it. So, I think that the experiences I have had starting when I was in an advocate taking on the establishment, going on to be first lady, taking on the drug companies and the pharmacy companies, taking on the financial system, taking on a lot of big lobbies like the gun lobby, I think that I have shown that I have got a lot of experience taking on the establishment. And I'm proud of what I bring to the table to actually be able to solve problems and get results for people.
DICKERSON: All right, Secretary Clinton, we will have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.
CLINTON: Great to talk to you, John. Thanks.

43,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5000,"February 7, 2016","Interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News ""Meet the Press""",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111588,Hillary Clinton,"TODD: We'll have my interview this morning with Donald Trump in just a few minutes. But we're going to begin with the Democrats and former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. You liked that ""graveyard of pollsters"" line, didn't you?
CLINTON: Well, I've lived through this twice —
TODD: You've lived through this.
CLINTON: — in '92 and 2008. And look, I know I'm behind. And I'm going to keep fighting until the very last vote is counted because I care about this primary.
TODD: Why do you think you started with such a big deficit this time, considering — look, this has been a big state to both your husband and yourself, very important.
CLINTON: Yes.
TODD: They've always helped you.
CLINTON: Well, look, I can't sit here and analyze all the reasons. Obviously, one is that the senator has been in public life next door for 25 years. So there's a familiarity with him. I totally respect that. And I just think that what's great about this primary is New Hampshire voters take a first, second, third, fourth, fifth look. I mean, yesterday, as I was crisscrossing from one side of the state to the other, talking to voters, I literally had people come up, say you changed my mind, you know, who knows. I mean, this is what's so exciting about the primary, Chuck. I came in in 2008, as I recall, like 16 points behind. I remember the night before the primary in '92, Bill's pollster saying, you know, you're in single digits. It's over. Who knows. I love this excitement. And you know, I'm going to fight as hard as I can. But I'm having a great time whatever happens.
TODD: All right. Let's — I want to go to the debate a little bit because I would say the foreign policy section is one that you guys wanted to highlight because you felt as if he didn't do so well. You brought up Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to talk about it. But some of the things that you said about Senator Obama's readiness on foreign policy, they are very similar to what you've said about Bernie Sanders. In '08, you said, ""I have a lifetime of experience that I will bring to the White House. I know Senator McCain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the White House."" Senator Obama has a speech he gave in 2002; it sounds very similar to what you said when you're like, OK, you had one vote on the Iraq war —
CLINTON: Well, you know what —
TODD: What's the difference between what you said about then- Senator Obama and what you're saying about Senator Sanders?
CLINTON: There's a very big difference. In 2008, Senator Obama had really done his homework in the Senate. He'd been there by that time a few years. He had developed a network of advisors on national security and foreign policy issues. They were very diligent and focused on making sure he was ready, that he had as broad a set of views as possible. And they really went toe-to-toe with all the people supporting me. That's not happening in this campaign. There really isn't any kind of foreign policy network that is supporting and advising Senator Sanders. I'll let him speak for himself. I think that what's important is this job requires you to be ready on all aspects of it on the first day. And we know we got a particularly complex world right now. And the president's not going to have the time. Maybe previous presidents in past years could have a little more leeway because of, you know, the way the world functioned. But now it's North Korea with its missile tests, it's Russian aggression, it's enforcing the Iran agreement. You have to do it all at once.
TODD: Do you think the Iraq vote should still matter to voters?
CLINTON: Look, I think that voters are perfectly free to take into account anything they want to take. But I also hope they'll take the rest of the record. You know, I was involved in the biggest counterterrorism decision in the Obama administration to determine whether or not to go after bin Laden. I did put the sanctions on Iran to get them to the negotiating table. I think that this is a debate that the voters really have to pay attention to because it is choosing both a president and a commander in chief.
TODD: I'm curious, do you believe if it wasn't for the Iraq War we wouldn't have ISIS today?
CLINTON: Well, I think that's a hard conclusion to draw because, remember, we had Al Qaeda before we had ISIS. Al Qaeda attacked us in New York. Al Qaeda attacked our embassies in Africa —
[crosstalk]
TODD: The argument is that the instability in Iraq is what has created this and that if we — that if Saddam Hussein were still there, we wouldn't have ISIS.
CLINTON: Well, I think that's a lot of jumps in logic that to me doesn't really add up. The Iraq War, there's no doubt, contributed to instability. I'm not going to in any way deny that. But you cannot draw a direct line. What you can do is to say that jihadist terrorism starting with Al Qaeda —
TODD: Right.
CLINTON: — and moving onto its latest incarnations, most particularly ISIS, is in response to a number of forces and factors that are roiling up the Middle East. And certainly fighting for what Islam means and how it's going to be presented and what people are going to mean when they talk about it — so, yes, we've got a much bigger set of problems.
TODD: All right. Another thing I wanted to follow up on the debate. Senator Sanders called the entire business model of Wall Street a fraud. We didn't get a chance to ask you to respond directly to that critique. I'd like to ask you to respond to it now.
CLINTON: Well, I think it's the kind of extreme statement that, once you really take a hard look at it, it's hard to understand. You know, when you talk about Wall Street, are we talking about every bank? Or are we talking about a particular part of New York? That's never really clarified. What I believe is that there are good actors and bad actors in every part of our economy. The job of the president is to weed out and prevent the bad actors from disrupting economic activity, from amassing too much power and influence. But we live in a complex global economy where we've got to have a good banking system that is able to service the American economy. And it needs to be more than just looking at the five banks that are the big banks. We have to have a much more robust community banking system, regional banking system, other forms of credit access. And that's what I am advocating for. And I still do not understand why I'm having this problem getting Senator Sanders to join me in going after what are the potential problems that are out there, the shadow banking sector and the investment and hedge fund sector.
TODD: Do you — can you have a Treasury Secretary who isn't familiar with how Wall Street works? And I say this because I think there's so much distrust right now.
CLINTON: Yes. There is. There is.
TODD: On Wall Street. Six of the last Treasury Secretaries either came from Wall Street or went to Wall Street after. I think there certainly right now isn't an appetite for somebody from Wall Street to be the next Treasury Secretary. And yet can you have a Treasury Secretary if they don't understand Wall Street?
CLINTON: Well, you have to have a Treasury Secretary who understands the economy, the American economy and the global economy. I think there are a lot more places where one can and should look for such a Treasury Secretary —
[crosstalk]
TODD: Do you think you can pick one without having them have a Wall Street background?
CLINTON: You know, I want somebody who can make a good commitment to work with me to get the economy moving, to get more good jobs created, to get incomes rising, to look out over the horizon at some of the economic problems that are out there. We've got to figure out what we're going to do with China. China is finally having to come to grips with the fact that a lot of its growth may not have been as on a firm foundation as we would hope. So we need people in government who have that kind of commitment and understanding. But we've got to put the needs of the American economy first. And that's going to be my commitment.
TODD: Before I let you go, I want to ask you about a comment Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said — a comment that I've heard her say before. But it sort of rang differently to a lot of people. She said, there's a special place in hell for women who don't help women. But the implication is that somehow, if you're a Democratic woman and you're not supporting you, what's wrong with you? Do you want the vote to be decided on gender lines like that?
CLINTON: Oh, look, you know, as you remember, Madeleine has been saying this for many, many years.
TODD: Starbucks cups, I think, centers on that. I get that.
CLINTON: She believes it firmly and., in part, because she knows what a struggle it has been. And she understands the struggle is not over. So I don't want people to be offended by what she is expressing as her very —
TODD: You can understand why some might have been offended by it?
CLINTON: Well, good grief, we're getting offended about everything these days. Honest to goodness, I mean, people can't say anything without offending somebody. She has a life experience that I respect. I admire her greatly. And I think what she was trying to do, which she's done in every setting I've ever seen her, in going back 20-plus years, was to remind young women particularly that this struggle, which many of us have been part of is, not over. And don't be in any way lulled by the progress we've made. And I think it was a light-hearted but very pointed remark, which people can take however they choose.
TODD: All right. What do you got in the Super Bowl?
CLINTON: I don't have anybody right now.
TODD: You don't have anybody?
CLINTON: I'm going to Flint, Michigan, I'm worrying about the kids in Flint, Michigan, trying to figure out what we're going to do to make sure they're not damaged irreparably by this —
TODD: So you're going today, you could have gone Wednesday. That says something about how you feel about New Hampshire?
CLINTON: I love New Hampshire. And you know, the mayor asked me to come. This was as early as we could get it done. I want to lend my support. I'm very hopeful the Congress, which is trying to work in a bipartisan way, will come up with some funding to deal with these problems that have afflicted the community. And I'm going to keep doing everything I can to help them.
TODD: Secretary Clinton, I know you got a plane to catch.
CLINTON: Thanks. Great to talk to you.

Hillary Clinton is actually going to leave the campaign trail here in New Hampshire to visit Flint, Michigan, today. But, first, she's right here... [laughter] ... right next to me, live. Secretary Clinton, thanks so much for being here.
CLINTON: Well, Jake, congratulations on doing the debate in Flint. It's really important we keep the spotlight on this problem. And you're right. I'm leaving here. I'm going to Flint. The mayor asked me to come. They're trying to, you know, really have a lot of support, because we hope that there will be some good news coming out of Congress in the next few days. And it's just — it's an issue that I don't want people to forget about. Because it's not the only Flint in our country.
TAPPER: Right.
CLINTON: There are other places where these kinds of toxins, lead, other sorts of pollutants are really affecting people's lives. And I'm just not going to give up on this.
TAPPER: Can I ask you a question? Just a clarification of what you think needs to be done in term of the people there...
CLINTON: Yes.
TAPPER: ... who need water and need infrastructure built.
CLINTON: Right.
TAPPER: You have called for the citizens of Michigan, the State of Michigan to be billed, but you're also supporting this bill from senators Stabenow and Peters from Michigan that would make it a federal payment.
CLINTON: Right.
TAPPER: Do you think that it should be a state issue in terms of the money paying for Flint, or should it be a federal issue?
CLINTON: It should be both and partly because there's a broad set of needs that have to be addressed. Yes, the infrastructure must be repaired and modernized. Yes, we do have to get emergency means in to get water, get the kind of nutritional support. You know, I know something about lead poisoning because of work I've done in the past and —
TAPPER: With the Children's Defense Fund?
CLINTON: Well, and as a senator from New York. We had a lot of, you know, old housing with lead paint in it. A lot of kids suffered from lead poisoning. And part of the challenge is you've got to intervene early. We need comprehensive health screenings. Then we need to figure out how do we get the right nutrition and vitamins. You've got to begin to work to counteract the lead. Then we've got to get the educational, additional help that kids need. This is a big deal, because it's not only about fixing the infrastructure, but it's also about the future. How we're going to take care of these kids going forward. So there's a lot of work to be done. And I think it has to be both the state and a federal responsibility.
TAPPER: You know, what's really so upsetting is as you know, just a little bit of lead can cause permanent damage.
CLINTON: There is no — there is no acceptable level of lead for kids.
TAPPER: Yes. Exactly.
CLINTON: None.
TAPPER: So according to what we know now, the state knew, at least in February — and the federal EPA knew at least in April, and yet it wasn't until months, months later. So obviously, this is a failing on the local level. But do you also think it's a failing by the EPA?
CLINTON: Well, I think it has to be absolutely investigated to figure out what happened. Why wasn't this sounding alarms everywhere? And I don't want to prejudge it. I don't know what the answer to that question is. I'm focused on OK, what do we do now? The damage has been done. How do we mitigate that damage? How do we help alleviate both intellectual and the physical, lasting consequences that children face when they've been poisoned by lead? So I'm trying to look at the future. I know there will be a lot of people focusing on what happened and that's really important, because we do have to, you know, open this inquiry more broadly. You know, I've said that we've got places in our country where we have asthma rates at 500 times higher, killing, you know, young children of color than anybody else because of where they live and what they're exposed to. You know, our children's health should be the highest priority for our country, and so anything I can do, and I'll keep doing it to really beat the drums on this but to ask people hey, let's look everywhere. You know, Flint — we've got to help flint. It's a terrible, horrible set of circumstances.
TAPPER: Mm-hmm.
CLINTON: But we also have to be looking at other places to try to make sure that this doesn't happen to other kids.
TAPPER: So I can't help but notice it's also the New Hampshire primaries coming up in two day.
CLINTON: Oh, it is? [laughter]
TAPPER: So just to move to politics for one second. Your family has a long history here. You obviously won here in 2008. Your husband staged his comeback here in 1992. Can you win here? Is it possible that you can win here?
CLINTON: I don't know. I don't know. I'm just going to work as hard as I can. I love the New Hampshire primary. I love it because the interactions you have with voters in every setting is so rewarding, and voters in this state take a first, second, third, fourth look at you. They're constantly evaluating. I have been telling voters across the state, this is the biggest job interview in the world. You've got to really think hard about what the job is, who can be president, who can be commander in chief, and then you have to really judge us. And I don't know what's going to happen. I know I'm behind. I am in very good spirits about that because I love the process.
TAPPER: So you said the other night at the — I forget if it was the debate or the town hall, they all run together in my mind, but you said one of them that nobody can point to an example where you took money from a group...
CLINTON: Right.
TAPPER: ... and changed your vote. The Sanders campaign afterwards sent out an excerpt from a book from Elizabeth Warren in which she suggests that you took $140,000.00 from the banking interests, and as a result, according to Warren, not me, changed your vote on the bankruptcy bill.
CLINTON: Right. Right.
TAPPER: Now I want — I would love it if you would address the substance of the allegation. And also the fact that Sanders' campaign sent it out, but Sanders himself backed off from making the charge himself.
CLINTON: Well. that's their — that's their typical, you know, artistic smear. You know, the campaign sends out something, gets people riled up, and then they say oh no, we're running a positive campaign. Enough. OK, I'm glad you raised this, because I really do want to get this record straight once and for all. I worked with Senator Warren with whom I have the highest regard, in 2000 to stop a very bad bankruptcy bill. And then when I got to the Senate in 2001, early on, there was going to be a vote on another bankruptcy bill. I was deluged — now as a senator, not as a first lady lobbying and working against this bill, I was deluged by women's groups and children's groups because the version of the bill that was going to be voted on did not protect child support, did not protect vulnerable women and their children from what would happen to them if their partner, their spouse went into bankruptcy and was able to discharge those obligations. And, you know, literally, people I had worked with for 30 years came and said nobody else will do this. You've got to help us. We've got to change that provision. I took that on. And I went to the floor. And I buttonholed the Democrats and the Republicans who were leading that bill. I said, you can't do this. You've got to change that provision. And they did. But they also put it to me. They said, if we change this provision, you have to vote for the bill. Now, that's what happens sometimes. I didn't like the bill any more than I had liked it before. It still had very bad provision. But I also pushed hard for a deal to protect women and children. So OK, I held my nose. I voted for it. It never became law. When it came back in 2005, I was against it. I didn't actually get to vote against it because Bill was in the hospital with another heart procedure, but I put out a statement on the floor. You can look at what I said in 2001. You can look at what I said in 2005. And so I'm glad to set this record straight. You know, but this kind of attack by innuendo, insinuation is really getting old. You know, hey can't point to anything. They are grabbing at straws to make this case. But let's ask Senator Sanders' campaign, why did he vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives? One of the key reasons for the Lehman brothers being over leveraged, collapsing and helping to bring down the economy. You know, this is a debate that we should be having about what our public records are and where we stand. I have the toughest, most effective campaign plan to take on the entire financial industry. I don't understand why he doesn't join me. Because it goes a lot further than anything he is proposing. We have to look at the shadow banking industry. Everybody knows where I stand on this. So I think we should end with the smear and the insinuation and talk about our respective plans.
TAPPER: A lot of your supporters were very upset this last week when some older male pundits suggested that you are a shouter. Now, I would observe — I would observe that Bernie Sanders doesn't exactly talk in a whisper. But that said, do you think that — do you think that the coverage of you is sexist? Do you think that when male pundits say things like that, they have a different standard for you?
CLINTON: And I don't want to single anybody out, Jake. Look, we are still living with a double standard and I know it. Every woman I know knows it. Whether you're in the media as a woman, or you're in the professions or business or politics. And I don't know anything other to do than to just keep forging through it and just taking the slings and arrows that come with being a woman in the arena. You know, sometimes I talk soft. Sometimes I get passionate and I get a little bit excited. I don't know any man who doesn't do the same thing. And I find it sort of interesting that all of a sudden this is a big discussion about me, once again. I'm so used to this. I'm going to keep making my case. I'm going to keep talking about what I will do as president. I'm going to keep laying out my record. Because I think it's really important that this election be actually about who can do the job that needs to be done starting in January of 2017.
TAPPER: Last question, madam secretary. How has this experience of running for president changed you, if it has?
CLINTON: You know, I think the most amazing learning experience. And having gone through this now twice, I think I am a different person than I was back in '08. I think that the experience I had as secretary of state has given me a perspective and an understanding of a lot of the issues that is deep and gives me the confidence to know that I can do every part of the job. But you run at different points in a country's, you know, thinking. And right now we're at a time when people are on both sides, Republicans, Democrats, right, left, people are really worried that our economy isn't working for them, that our government isn't working for them. And that's causing a lot of the anger and the frustration. I totally get that. I feel it. You know, things have been going on that are just wrong. These Supreme Court decisions against voting rights, Citizens United — those are dramatically altering the balance of power in our country. The great recession, for which there were a number of causes, but you have to look at the failure of the Bush administration to regulate what was going on in the financial and mortgage markets. People deserve to be upset. But what I'm saying — and maybe it's not the most popular theme these days. You know, get angry, vent, but then realize anger is not a plan and venting is not a strategy, and we have work to do. And I'm confident we can do that work. But we're going to have to roll up our sleeves and say OK, we've got to make sure the economy works for everybody, not just those at the top. Here's my plan for jobs and raising incomes. We've got to make sure the Affordable Care Act gets the cost down, but gets coverage to 100 percent. Here's what I can do about that. Let's have a discussion about what you would be thinking if you were conducting a job interview. OK, I've got the experience, I've got the passion. And here's what I'm going to do with it. And that's what I think the country needs, because people are just whipping them up. I mean, on the Republican side, all of this rhetoric, this demagoguery, which plays to the fears and the insecurities that people feel. And I just think that's not who we are. We are the premier problem-solvers of human history. We've got to get back to doing that together.
TAPPER: All right, Madam Secretary. We'll see you on the campaign trail. Good luck on Tuesday.
CLINTON: I'll be there. Thank you.
TAPPER: Thanks so much for stopping by. Appreciate it.
CLINTON: Nice to talk to you.

CLINTON: My pleasure to see you again.
MADDOW: So, we're very close to voting in New Hampshire.
CLINTON: We are.
MADDOW: The polls show Senator Sanders still significantly ahead. If you do not win in New Hampshire, does that imply that there's going to be — or in your mind, does that mean you need to change course at all? Will that mean your campaign going ahead will be different than leading into this?
CLINTON: You know, Rachel, I've always had a different view on this than I think maybe some others have. I always knew Iowa was going to be really, really hard. And we won, narrow, but a win is a win.
MADDOW: One quarter of one percent.
CLINTON: Yes, I'm always happy about that. I always knew that Senator Sanders been in public life next door for 25 years, he's on the Congress for that long, he had a tremendous amount of familiarity and a sense of really belonging in the area. So, I always knew this was going to be hard. I feel good about the campaign we waged here. I think we have an uphill battle. We're going to battle it until the last votes are counted and we're going to turn around and head off for the next contest.
MADDOW: Politico.com just this afternoon just published something that says that there's changes in the works. There's always these sort of campaign gossip stories. But they are say — they say they're citing a half dozen people with direct knowledge of the situation. Their lead is, ""Hillary and Bill Clinton are so dissatisfied with their campaign's messaging and digital operations, they're considering staffing and strategy changes after what's expected to be a loss in Tuesday's primary."" Are you planning some sort of shake up like that?
CLINTON: Yes, somebody showed that to me. I have no idea what they are talking about or who they are talking to. We're going to take stock. But it's going to be the campaign I've got. I'm confident in the people I have. I'm very committed to them. They're committed to doing the best we can. We're going to take stock. What works, what doesn't work? We're moving into a different phase of the campaign. We're moving into different geographic areas. So, of course, it would be malpractice not to say, OK, what worked? What can we do better? What can we do new and different that we have to pull out?
MADDOW: President Clinton was here with you today as was your daughter. President Clinton did his own event yesterday which made some headlines, when he had some very harsh criticism for Senator Sanders campaign, essentially calling Senator Sanders and his campaign hypocritical, dishonest, calling out sexism from Senator Sanders supporters. Although Senator Sanders have called out his on supporters for sexism and said he will not tolerate it. Is President Clinton going further than you would in those criticisms for the Sanders campaign or do you also share the view that he's been dishonest and hypocritical?
CLINTON: Well, here's my view, and I think Bill was really defending my supporters because we know a lot of them are being harassed online, they're being harassed at our events. They are being really treated badly. Look, I'm all for people who are for my opponent. I think it's great to bring in as many new, young people as possible. I want people treated respectfully. I think that's part of what he was talking about. I have been concerned about tone of his campaign over the last weeks. We were running I thought a good campaign on issues. We're getting to the point we have to draw contrasts. That's natural. You know, I have a health care approach. He has a health care approach. We may have the same goal, but we have a different view about how we get there. That is fair game, as it should be. But there has been a constant undercurrent that I said in the debate last week, was a kind of attack by innuendo, insinuation, kind of artful smears. And I just said enough is enough. You know, if you have something to say to my face, say it. If you can point to any event, any vote, any view that you think has been influenced by any donation I've ever made, call it out, you know? Then, they put up the bankruptcy bill. I answered that yesterday on the morning shows. And so, I want this innuendo to stop. You know, let's just be honest with each other. Look, Senator Sanders has taken money from Wall Street. He took it through the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. That's what we do. That doesn't mean his views are compromised. It doesn't mean my views and it doesn't mean that President Obama's views when he was running for the presidency — he took a lot of money from Wall Street — in any way stopped him from pushing through and signing Dodd Frank and imposing tough rules. So, it's a — you know, he gets his supporters — he sends some messages and his campaign then amplifies those messages. And then a lot of his young people get really worked up and they're going off on tangents. They can attack me, that's fine. I'm in the arena. But to go after journalists who say something nice about me, to go after supporters who post things, to go after elected officials who are for me, because, you know, I have the vast majority of elected officials on the Democratic side because they know us both. And they know I would be the president who can actually get done what I'm saying.
MADDOW: As a journalist, and who is an out and proud liberal, I get attacked 50/50 by people who say I'm a dyed in the wool partisan for Bernie and then the other 50 said, it said I'm dyed in the wool partisan for you. And people really have decided one way or the other, about 50/50, that I'm completely in the tank. I do not notice a difference in the tone or the nastiness or the snark or the inappropriateness of those attacks that I get from the people who support you or Senator Sanders. If you did want to change the tone of things from your supporters, could you? I mean, he said he doesn't want sexism and other forms of offensive comments from his supporters, can he do more than he is? Could you do more than you do?
CLINTON: I think we should do what we can. But I'm also focused on what he says. You know, his argument basically is this. Anyone who has taken a donation from anyone connected with Wall Street is compromised. They're vote has been bought. They can't be trusted. That is just not true. If it is true, now it includes him we know because he's taken contributions from Wall Street.
MADDOW: He said yesterday that no politician, there's never been a politician in history who says, yes, the money that I took influences me. So, therefore, essentially implying like the defense that there isn't, that you don't claim to be been influenced is by the donations is no defense.
CLINTON: But let's put out the proof, Rachel. Don't listen to what people say. I find it deeply offensive. You know, I have worked really hard. I've taken on many more powerful groups than he has. I've taken on the drug companies, the insurance companies. I've got big oil going after me. I've got hedge fund guys spending $6 millions of dollars in ads against me, which I would think would raise an interesting question if they are so worried about Bernie, why are they trying to defeat me? I've taken onto gun lobby, something that, you know, he never has done. So, I've got the scars to prove my bona fides and what I'm willing to take on and how I've stood firm against an onslaught of attacks, you know, turning me into the political pinata sometimes. So, point to the evidence. Otherwise, stop it. Let's talk about I want to get to universal coverage building on the Affordable Care Act. You want to start over with single payer. Let the people decide what's the best way to do this. So, that's what this should be about.
MADDOW: On the — staying for a moment on that, that line of attack. You had mentioned in the debate when Chuck asked you about transcripts of speeches that you gave paid speeches, that you would look into it. We've had some further word from your campaign that there may be a release of those transcripts. What's the status of that? Do you expect to release those speeches?
CLINTON: Well, you know what I said the other day — you know, look, I'm getting a little bit weary of the double standard. There's a lot of people on both sides. If we're going to start saying what you did when you're out of public office, when you're in the private sector, what you did, fair game. Release it all. I'm all for that.
MADDOW: You mean all presidential candidates?
CLINTON: Yes, everybody, release everything. But again, I've been asking to do something for which there's no basis, just the attempt to cast suspicion. So, I said I will look into it. We will look into it. But, you know, what's good for the gander should be good for the goose. [laughter]
MADDOW: So, you wouldn't do it unilaterally, but if everybody's going to do it, you would do it?
CLINTON: Well, this is — I'm really not thinking about it until I get through New Hampshire, to be honest. I want to get through tomorrow, and then, you know, it's going to be very boring for people once it is done under whatever circumstances.
MADDOW: Did you see the Republican debate on Saturday night?
CLINTON: I was at my own event in Portsmouth. So, I — I did not see.
MADDOW: Have you been able to resist the temptation to watch the clips of Marco Rubio saying the same thing over and over and over again?
CLINTON: I did get to see that because I was on every news channel that I was flipping around.
MADDOW: Do you have — I mean, he's seen as at least coming out of Iowa as having a lot of momentum as a potential nominee for the Republican Party. Do you have any reaction or opinion about that performance from him?
CLINTON: I'm going to leave my opinions to myself because I don't want to in any way influence their process, because they have to make their decision and clearly, the longer it lasts and the more difficult it is, the better it will be for us.
MADDOW: I went to some Republican candidate events since I've been up here and —
CLINTON: They let you in?
MADDOW: They let me in. I wear a baseball hat. Incognito situation. But I specifically wanted to talk to women voters who were there at Republican candidate events. And I found a number of different women to talk to. Some are dyed this wool Republicans, but more often I found are women open to the idea of voting for a Democrat. I talked to a few women who voted for Barack Obama either last time or in 2008. But they are shopping for a Republican candidate this year. And 2-1, the reason they said they are shopping for a Republican candidate and not thinking about voting here in the Democratic side is because they do not believe that you are honest. They have issue with your trustworthiness. I know you see this come up in the polls and people talk about their feelings about the various candidates. I'm sure you disagree with that assessment from them. I understand that. But how do you make the case to people, to women in particular for whom that's the objection. That's why they can't pull the lever for you.
CLINTON: You know, obviously, this is not anything I want to hear because I find it so absolutely contrary to who I am and who all these people who support me, who know me, work with me and count on me know who I am. But I thought a lot about it, Rachel, because when you think back, I emerged on the national scene in 1992. I have been under relentless attack ever since. Now, just read behavioral science, read psychology, even when the attacks proved to be unfounded, untrue, it leaves a residue, right? People say, well, why is she being attacked so much? It must be something there. So, I get through the '90s. I run for the Senate. Same thing happen. I worked, I gained the trust of the people of New York. When I run again, I get a larger percentage of the vote. So, people who see me in action, people who count on me, people who know that if I tell you something intend to do, I will do everything in my power to make that happen. Then President-elect Obama turns around after that hard fought campaign with all sorts of accusations flying around, say I trust you, I want you to be my secretary of state. When I'm holding office, I get along well with Republicans. I will always have the, you know, right wingers who are never going to give up on trying to push me down and push me out. They view me as a threat. And I accept that. But when I get to work with people, we get things done. And that's been my pattern. So, when I get that question and I ask people, I say what is it you are really reacting to? Very often they don't know. Then a lot of them will say, well, Benghazi. I said, OK, Benghazi. You know, did you know there were nine separate investigations, eight of them independent, one of them clearly partisan admittedly to try to bring me down politically. And they all reach the same conclusions. There were things we could have and should have done better. I immediately said we would. I testified for 11 hours. I answered every question, but it's still on the TV. I hear people talking about it. I can't stop them from talking about it. I can only tell you what the facts are. I can tell you that in the last, what, 36, 37 years, we've had terrorist problems in Iran, in Lebanon, in Kenya, in Tanzania, in New York and, yes, in Benghazi — none of them were every politicized. We lost 258 marines and embassy personnel in Beirut. The Democrats didn't stand up and go after the secretary of state. We lost people in Kenya and Tanzania, 12 Americans, hundreds of Africans. Madeleine Albright was secretary of state, she forthrightly asked for a report. She made it public. People didn't turn it into a partisan attack. So, I have to only conclude that there is a concerted effort to try to make partisan advantage by really throwing some much at me that even if little splotches of it stick, it will cloud people's judgment of me. So, that's a burden I carry. But when you stop and think, you know, the people who have supported me are not doing it because they just like me. I have the governor of Vermont supporting me. I have Pat Leahy, the senator from Vermont supporting me, the two former governors, Madeleine Kunin and Howard Dean supporting me. They clearly know us both. They clearly prefer to support me. I have the senator here, the governor in New Hampshire. They know me. They trust me. They're not the kind of people who would just sign onto campaign for some frivolous reason. I have all my friends from the Senate, Cory Booker and Tim Kaine and Kirsten Gillibrand and Debbie Stabenow and Amy Klobuchar, they were all up here in the snow because they believe in me, and they trust me. So, I can't stop the barrage of attacks. I want your viewers and anyone else who would be interested in this to ask themselves, why does the right and particularly the Republicans, spend so much time, money and effort through the media, through their advertising because you look at the Republicans are running more ads against me than they run against each other, accusing me of being this and that, all kinds of accusations. Why? I'll tell you why, because they are afraid of me. They know that I will be a president who, yes, I will listen to people, I will seek common ground, but I will stand my ground and I know how to get things done. And that's the last thing these guys want to see again.
MADDOW: What did you learn by going there that you didn't need before?
CLINTON: Nothing substitutes for sitting like I did and you were there when you were there with mothers who told me about what had happened to their families. A mother who moved to Flint just serendipitously right up at the time the crisis was beginning, a year ago April, pregnant with twins, started seeing rashes, lost her twins. Just sitting there like I'm sitting with you just hearing that story, you know there is a depth of emotion and horror frankly associated with not being able to trust the water you drink and that you bathe your baby in. And listening to a lot of officials explained in detail how little control they had because their city was under emergency management under the governor, getting into the real detail about what they could and couldn't do and how they literally couldn't get phone calls returned, letters answered, talking to some of the water warriors who have been on this issue and doing everything they could to bring it to public attention, talking to the doctors who are leading up the efforts to test kid and what more they need. It really filled out in great excruciating detail how terribly damaged and abused this community has been and it reminded me that people have a right to be angry. I have no argument with the anger, the insecurity, the fear, the worry that people have when your government fails you, when the economy fails you, when politics fails you, anger is a natural and frankly expected result. But as we were talking yesterday and as this incredible mayor who has just taken this city on her back and is trying to lift it up said, OK, we are so distraught, our hearts are broken. Our stomachs are sick with worry about what happens next, but we need a plan. So I came to try to get them more support, working with all levels of government to try to make sure they had whatever they needed to do as much as possible to empower themselves, and I got a long list of, you know, follow up I will be doing over the next weeks.
MADDOW: You said yesterday you were making a personal commitment you would see it through —
CLINTON: Yes.
MADDOW: — to the end. I will say just my opinion being there, my felling when I was there was that I couldn't believe, the basic things that families needed to cope on a day-to-day basis were not attended to. What I aim at specifically there is no day-to-day delivery of clean water in Flint. So, there's a lot love people, average, poor American city, people don't have transportation or people could be house bound, elderly people, right now, still, to this day, today the day before the New Hampshire primary, the plan is for people to go out to the fire stations and collect their allotted one case of bottled water per day — is there a sense in which the emergency, not just fixing it for the long haul, but the emergency of what people need day-to-day still isn't being attended to and there ought to be some quicker response right now?
CLINTON: Yes. Yes. Look, as I said yesterday, we've got a very big infrastructure problem that has to be fixed. Congress is working on that, my friend Debbie Stabenow is really leading the charge. We have a huge set of problems having to do with the needs that people have that are not being met. You mentioned one of them, clean water. We still don't have all the testing set up to be done.
MADDOW: Right.
CLINTON: We don't have the planning yet for what has to happen in the schools. We don't know whether we can get not just clean water, but the kind of nutrition that can maybe begin to mitigate to some extent the affects of blood before it gets from the bloodstream into tissues, muscles, et cetera. So, we have a long list and I brought some folks with me who are going to stay involved and help with that planning process and we have a big lack of trust, and one of the things that I have advocated is we need to find a way, not just to empower, but to hire people in the community, to be the outreach workers, to do the water delivery, to be on the front lines in their neighborhoods. So, we're putting together under the mayor's leadership a kind of matrix of tasks and who can do them, what they need to be able to do them. A lot of them don't need training. Some of them might. And so, how do we piece all this together and talking with the city council, county commissioners and others, there's roles for everybody to play, but somebody has to have the overall approach that is followed.
MADDOW: And quick.
CLINTON: Yes, and very quick.

46,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5000,"March 21, 2016","Remarks at the AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington, DC",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116600,Hillary Clinton,"Thank you so much. It is wonderful to be here and see so many friends. I've spoken at a lot of AIPAC conferences in the past, but this has to be one of the biggest yet and there are so many young people here, thousands of college students from hundreds of campuses around the country. I think we should all give them a hand for being here and beginning their commitment to this important cause.
You will keep the U.S.-Israel relationship going strong. You know, as a senator from New York and secretary of state I've had the privilege of working closely with AIPAC members to strengthen and deepen America's ties with Israel. Now, we may not have always agreed on every detail, but we've always shared an unwavering, unshakable commitment to our alliance and to Israel's future as a secure and democratic homeland for the Jewish people.
And your support helped us expand security and intelligence, cooperation, develop the Iron Dome missile defense system, build a global coalition to impose the toughest sanctions in the history on Iran and so much more. Since my first visit to Israel 35 years ago, I've returned many times and made many friends. I've worked with and learned from some of Israel's great leaders, although, I don't think Yitzhak Rabin ever forgave me for banishing him to the White House balcony when he wanted to smoke.
Now I'm here as a candidate for president and I know that all of you understand what's at stake in this election. Our next president will walk into the Oval Office next January and immediately face a world of both perils we must meet with strength and skill and opportunities we must seize and build on. The next president will sit down at that desk and start making decisions that will affect both the lives and livelihoods of every American and the security of our friends around the world.
So we have to get this right. As AIPAC members, you understand that while the turmoil of the Middle East presents enormous challenge and complexity, walking away is not an option.
Candidates for president who think the United States can outsource Middle East security to dictators or that America no longer has vital national interests at stake in this region are dangerously wrong. It would be a serious mistake for the United States to abandon our responsibilities or cede the mantle of leadership for global peace and security to anyone else.
As we gather here, three evolving threats, Iran's continued aggression, a rising tide of extremism across a wide ark of instability and the growing effort to delegitimize Israel on the world stage are converging to make the U.S.-Israel alliance more indispensable than ever.
We have to combat all these trends with even more intense security and diplomatic cooperation. United States and Israel must be closer than ever, stronger than ever and more determined than ever to prevail against our common adversaries and to advance our shared values.
This is especially true at a time when Israel faces brutal terrorist stabbings, shootings and vehicle attacks at home. Parents worry about letting their children walk down the street, families live in fear. Just a few weeks ago, a young American veteran and West Point graduate named Taylor Force was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist near the Jaffa Port. These attacks must end immediately and Palestinian leaders need to stop inciting violence, stop celebrating terrorists as martyrs and stop paying rewards to their families.
Because we understand the threats Israel faces, we know we can never take for granted the strength of our alliance or the success of our efforts. Today, Americans and Israelis face momentous choices that will shape the future of our relationship and of both our nations. The first choice is this, are we prepared to take the U.S.-Israel alliance to the next level? This relationship has always been stronger and deeper than the headlines might lead you to believe. Our work together to develop the Iron Dome saved many Israeli lives when Hamas rockets began to fly.
I saw its effectiveness firsthand in 2012, when I worked with Prime Minister Netanyahu to negotiate a seize fire in Gaza and if I'm fortunate enough to be elected president, the United States will reaffirm we have a strong and enduring national interest in Israel's security. And we will never allow Israel's adversaries to think a wedge can be driven between us.
When we have differences, as any friends do, we will work to resolve them quickly and respectfully. We will also be clear that the United States has an enduring interest in and commitment to a more peaceful, more stable, more secure Middle East and we will step up our efforts to achieve that outcome. Indeed, at a time of unprecedented chaos and conflict in the region, America needs an Israel strong enough to deter and defend against its enemies, strong enough to work with us to tackle shared challenges and strong enough to take bold steps in the pursuit of peace.
That's why I believe we must take our alliance to the next level. I hope a new 10-year defense memorandum of understanding is concluded as soon as possible to meet Israel's security needs far into the future. That will also send a clear message to Israel's enemies that the United States and Israel stand together united. It's also why, as president, I will make a firm commitment to ensure Israel maintains its qualitative military edge.
The United States should provide Israel with the most sophisticated defense technology so it can deter and stop any threat. That includes bolstering Israeli missile defenses with new systems, like the Arrow 3 and David's Sling, and we should work together to develop better tunnel detection technology to prevent arms smuggling, kidnapping and terrorist attacks.
One of the first things I'll do in office is invite the Israeli prime minister to visit the White House and I will send a delegation from the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs to Israel forearly consultations. Let's also expand our collaboration beyond security. Together we can build an even more vibrant culture of innovation that tightens the links between Silicon Valley and Israeli tech companies and entrepreneurs.
There is much Americans can learn from Israel from cybersecurity to energy security to water security and just on an everyday people to people level. And it's especially important to continue fostering relationships between American and Israeli young people who may not always remember our shared past. They are the future of our relationship and we have to do more to promote that. Many of the young people here today are on the front lines of the battle to oppose the alarming boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement known as BDS.
Particularly at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise across the world, especially in Europe, we must repudiate all efforts to malign, isolate and undermine Israel and the Jewish people.
I've been sounding the alarm for a while now. As I wrote last year to the heads of major American-Jewish organizations, we have to be united in fighting back against BDS. Many of its proponents have demonized Israeli scientists and intellectuals, even students. To all the college students who may have encountered this on campus, I hope you stay strong, keep speaking out, don't let anyone silence you, bully you or try to shut down debate, especially in places of learning like colleges and universities.
Anti-Semitism has no place in any civilized society. Not in America, not in Europe, not anywhere.
Now, all of this work defending Israel's legitimacy, expanding security and economic ties, taking our alliance to the next level depends on electing a president with a deep, personal commitment to Israel's future as a secure, democratic Jewish state and to America's responsibilities as a global leader. Tonight, you'll hear from candidates with very different visions of American leadership in the region and around the world. You'll get a glimpse of a potential U.S. foreign policy that would insult our allies, not engage them and embolden our adversaries, not defeat them.
For the security of Israel and the world, we need America to remain a respected global leader committed to defending and advancing the international order, an America able to block efforts to isolate or attack Israel. The alternative is unthinkable.
Yes, we need steady hands, not a president who says he's neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday and who knows what on Wednesday, because everything's negotiable. Well, my friends, Israel's security is non-negotiable.
I have sat in Israeli hospital rooms holding the hands of men and women whose bodies and lives were torn apart by terrorist bombs. I've listened to doctors describe the shrapnel left in a leg, an arm or even a head. That's why I feel so strongly that America can't ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security or survival. We can't be neutral when rockets rain down on residential neighborhoods, when civilians are stabbed in the street, when suicide bombers target theinnocent. Some things aren't negotiable and anyone who doesn't understand that has no business being our president.
The second choice we face is whether we will have the strength and commitment to confront the adversaries that threaten us, especially Iran. For many years, we've all been rightly focused on the existential danger of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon. After all, this remains an extremist regime that threatens to annihilate Israel.
That's why I led the diplomacy to impose crippling sanctions and force Iran to the negotiating table and why I ultimately supported the agreement that has put a lid on its nuclear program. Today, Iran's enriched uranium is all but gone, thousands of centrifuges have stopped spinning, Iran's potential breakout time has increased and new verification measures are in place to help us deter and detect any cheating.
I really believe the United States, Israel and the world are safer as a result, but still, as I laid out in a speech at the Brookings Institution last year, it's not good enough to trust and verify. Our approach must be distrust and verify.
This deal must come with vigorous enforcement, strong monitoring, clear consequences for any violations and a broader strategy to confront Iran's aggression across the region. We cannot forget that Tehran's fingerprints are on every conflict across the Middle East from Syria to Lebanon to Yemen. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its proxies are attempting to establish a position on the Golan from which to threaten Israel and they continue to fund Palestinian terrorists.
In Lebanon, Hezbollah is amassing an arsenal of increasingly sophisticated rockets and artillery that well may be able to hit every city in Israel. Tonight, you will hear a lot of rhetoric from the other candidates about Iran, but there's a big difference between talking about holding Tehran accountable and actually doing it. Our next president has to be able to hold together our global coalition and impose real consequences for even the smallest violations of this agreement.
We must maintain the legal and diplomatic architecture to turn all the sanctions back on if needed. If I'm elected, the leaders of Iran will have no doubt that if we see any indication that they are violating their commitments not to seek, develop or acquire nuclear weapons, the United States will act to stop it and that we will do so with force if necessary.
Iranian provocations, like the recent ballistic missile tests also are unacceptable and should be answered firmly and quickly, including with more sanctions.
Those missiles were stamped with words declaring, and I quote, ""Israel should be wiped from the pages of history."" We know they could reach Israel or hit the tens of thousands of American troops stationed in the Middle East. This is a serious danger and it demands a serious response.
The United States must also continue to enforce existing sanctions and impose additional sanctions as needed on Iran and the Revolutionary Guard for their sponsorship of terrorism, illegal arms transfers, human rights violations and other illicit behaviors, like cyber-attacks. We should continue to demand the safe return of Robert Levinson and all American citizens unjustly held in Iranian prisons.
And we must work closely with Israel and other partners to cut off the flow of money and arms from Iran to Hezbollah. If the Arab League can designate all of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, surely it is time for our friends in Europe and the rest of the international community to do so as well and to do that now.
At the same time, America should always stand with those voices inside Iran calling for more openness. Now look, we know the supreme leader still calls the shots and that the hardliners are intent on keeping their grip on power, but the Iranian people themselves deserve a better future and they are trying to make their voices heard. They should know that America is not their
enemy, they should know we will support their efforts to bring positive change to Iran.
Now, of course, Iran is not the only threat we and Israel face. The United States and Israel also have to stand together against the threat from ISIS and other radical jihadists. An ISIS affiliate in the Sinai is reportedly stepping up attempts to make inroads in Gaza and partners with Hamas.
On Saturday, a number of Israelis and other foreigners were injured or killed in a bombing in Istanbul that may well be linked to ISIS. Two of the dead are U.S.-Israeli dual nationals. This is a threat that knows no borders. That's why I've laid out a plan to take the fight to ISIS from the air, on the ground with local forces and online where they recruit and inspire. Our goal cannot be to contain ISIS; we must defeat ISIS.
And here is a third choice, will we keep working toward a negotiated peace or lose forever the goal of two states for two peoples? Despite many setbacks, I remain convinced that peace with security is possible and that it is the only way to guarantee Israel's long-term survival as a strong Jewish and democratic state.
It may be difficult to imagine progress in this current climate when many Israelis doubt that a willing and capable partner for peace even exists, but inaction cannot be an option. Israelis deserve a secure homeland for the Jewish people. Palestinians should be able to govern themselves in their own state in peace and dignity and only a negotiated two-state agreement can provide those outcomes.
If we look at the broader, regional context, converging interests between Israel and key Arab states could make it possible to promote progress on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Israelis and Palestinians could contribute to our greater cooperation between Israel and Arabs. I know how hard all of this is. I remember what it took just to convene Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas for the three sessions of direct face-to-face peace talks in 2010 that I presided over, but Israelis and Palestinians cannot give up on the hope of peace.
That will only make it harder later. All of us need to look for opportunities to create the conditions for progress, including by taking positive actions that can rebuild trust. Like the recent constructive meetings between the Israeli and Palestinian finance ministers aiming to help bolster the Palestinian economy or the daily on-the-ground security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
But at the same time, all of us must condemn actions that setback the cause of peace. Terrorism should never be encouraged or celebrated and children should not be taught to hate in schools.
That poisons the future. Everyone has to do their part by avoiding damaging actions, including with respect to settlements. Now, America has an important role to play in supporting peace efforts and as president, I would continue the pursuit of direct negotiations. And let me be clear, I would vigorously oppose any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council.
There is one more choice that we face together and in some ways, it may be the most important of all, will we as Americans and as Israelis stay true to the shared democratic values that have always been at the heart of our relationship? We are both nations built by immigrants and exiles seeking to live and worship in freedom, nations built on principles of equality, tolerance and pluralism.
At our best, both Israel and America are seen as a light unto the nations because of those values. This is the real foundation of our alliance and I think it's why so many Americans feel such a deep emotional connection with Israel. I know that I do and it's why we cannot be neutral about Israel and Israel's future, because in Israel's story, we see our own and the story of all people who struggle for freedom and self-determination.
There's so many examples. You know, we look at the pride parade in Tel Aviv, one of the biggest and most prominent in the world and we marvel that such a bastion of liberty exists in a region so plagued by intolerance. We see the vigorous, even raucous debate in Israeli politics and feel right at home.
And of course, some of us remember a woman, Golda Meir, leading Israel's government decades ago and wonder what's taking us so long here in America.
But we cannot rest on what previous generations have accomplished. Every generation has to renew our values and yes, even fight for them. Today, Americans and Israelis face currents of intolerance and extremism that threaten the moral foundations of our societies. Now, in a democracy, we're going to have differences, but what Americans are hearing on the campaign trail this year is something else entirely, encouraging violence, playing coy with white supremacists, calling for 12 million immigrants to be rounded up and deported, demanding we turn away refugees because of their religion and proposing a ban on all Muslims entering the United States.
Now, we've had dark chapters in our history before, we remember the nearly 1,000 Jews aboard the St. Louis who were refused entry in 1939 and sent back to Europe, but America should be better than this and I believe it's our responsibility as citizens to say so. If you see bigotry, oppose it. If you see violence, condemn it. If you see a bully, stand up to him.
On Wednesday evening, Jews around the world will celebrate the Festival of Purim and children will learn the story of Esther who refused to stay silent in the face of evil. It wasn't easy, she had a good life and by speaking out, she risked everything, but as Mordecai reminded her, we all have an obligation to do our part when danger gathers and those of us with power or influence have a special responsibility to do what's right.
As Elie Wiesel said when accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, ""Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented."" So my friends, let us never be neutral or silent in the face of bigotry. Together, let's defend the shared values that already make America and Israel great.
Let us do the hard work necessary to keep building our friendship and reach out to the next generation of Americans and Israelis so the bonds between our nations grow even deeper and stronger. We are stronger together and if we face the future side by side, I know for both Israel and America our best days are still ahead.
Thank you so much.

Today, the Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments for a set of cases that could pave the way for same-sex marriage across the country.
My partner Nate and I don't need to wait for the decision. We got engaged at the historic Stonewall Inn in New York—and like we shared in Hillary's campaign launch video, we're getting married in Chicago this summer.
But not everyone has that same freedom. In too many states, it's still against the law for two men or two women to make a commitment to love and care for each other. Dads can't adopt children. Moms can't visit one another in the hospital.
Our country has made so much progress in just the last ten years that marriage equality can often feel inevitable. But that is, unfortunately, wishful thinking. It can all be turned back with just one election.
There are some on the other side, including some who are running for president, who find my relationship intolerable. They see me and those like me as second-class citizens, unworthy of our right to pursue happiness.
As we saw just last month in Indiana—and as we continue to see around the world—people who are committed to discrimination can still find ways to act on it.
That's why I'm writing this, and why I was proud to help launch Hillary's campaign. She's been an advocate for equality for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Americans. She understands that my family is like her family and yours. We all deserve equal rights.
The arguments in front of the Supreme Court today are the beginning of what we hope is the final step before nationwide marriage equality.
But no matter what happens in the courts, I'm hopeful that come 2016, we'll elect a president who fights for all of us.
Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Lily from Iowa makes this pie with sour cherries from the Des Moines farmers' market—but her homemade H logo is the true cherry on top!
INGREDIENTS
Crust:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 sticks chilled unsalted butter, in 1/2-inch cubes
5 tablespoons ice water
Filling:
1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
5 cups whole pitted cherries (sour or dark sweet)
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice (if using sour cherries) or 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (if using dark sweet cherries)
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 stick unsalted butter, in 1/2-inch cubes
1 tablespoon milk
PIE PREP
Crust:
Mix flour, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add butter. Combine with your fingers until the mixture starts to form small clumps. Add ice water. Continue mixing, this time with a fork, until small balls of dough hold together when pressed. If the crust mixture is dry, add more water by the teaspoon. Divide the dough into two sections, forming each into a ball. Flatten each ball, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Let the dough soften, then roll it out.
Filling and lattice:
Preheat your oven to 425°F. Your oven rack should be in the lower third of the oven.
Use a whisk to combine 1 cup sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium bowl. Add cherries, lemon juice, and vanilla.
On a floured surface, roll out the first ball of dough into a 12-inch disk. Place it in a 9-inch glass pie dish. Trim the dough hanging over the side of the dish to 1/2 an inch. Add the filling to the pie dish, with slightly more in the center. Dot the filling with butter. Then roll out the second ball of dough on a floured surface into a second 12-inch disk. Cut ten 3/4-inch-wide strips out of the second flattened disk, and arrange them atop the filling in a lattice. Trim the strips of dough until they hang 1/2 inch over the side before folding the bottom crust over the ends of the strip and crimping the edges to seal the pie. Brush the lattice crust, but not the edges, with milk. Sprinkle the lattice with the remaining sugar (1 tablespoon).
BAKING INSTRUCTIONS
Set the pie on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. Adjust the oven temperature to 375°F. Bake for about an hour until the filling bubbles and the crust becomes golden brown, covering the edges with foil if they brown too quickly. Transfer your pie to a cooling rack and let it cool completely before serving.

We need to act.
33,636.
That's the number of Americans who died from gun violence in a single year. No other developed country loses as many people to gun violence each year as we do.
In fact, it's not even close.
The number of American lives lost to gun violence is more than three times the rate as the next country on the list. If that's shocking to you, it should be. But we need to do more than be shocked. We need to act.
Here's how Hillary will take on the epidemic of gun violence—with or without Congress's help.
Strengthen background checks
First things first: Hillary will start with what we know works. The background checks implemented by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act in 1993 have reduced gun trafficking, saved lives in domestic violence situations, and prevented dangerous individuals from getting their hands on guns.
The bottom line: Background checks work. But an estimated 20 to 40 percent of all gun transactions in the U.S. still happen with no background check at all. And that's largely because of loopholes in the current system.
Background checks are frequently not required if a person buys a gun online or at a gun show. And even when background checks do take place, there are dangerous loopholes: For example, because of the ""Charleston Loophole,"" if the background check is not completed within three days, the potential buyer is allowed to purchase the gun anyway. That's how the alleged shooter in Charleston, South Carolina, was able to buy a gun even with a federal criminal record.
Comprehensive background check legislation could save thousands of lives. And if Congress refuses to act, Hillary will take executive action to tighten the gun show and online sales loopholes.
Hold dealers and manufacturers accountable
The vast majority of gun dealers and manufacturers sell guns safely and responsibly.
But the few who don't follow the law are a real problem. In fact, they're flooding our communities with illegal guns. And too many Americans are dying as a direct result of our failure to hold these bad actors accountable. Gun violence is now the leading cause of death for young black men.
This deadly problem is made worse because gun manufacturers and dealers have some powerful friends. The NRA and their Republican allies have helped grant them unique legal protection—which means that in some cases, victims of gun violence can't hold them accountable for violence caused by their products. And the NRA has gone out of their way to ensure the people responsible for regulating gun dealers can't do their jobs.
Keep guns out of the hands of violent criminals and the severely mentally ill
It's common sense: No dangerous individual should be able to obtain a gun. That includes domestic abusers. But even though federal law prohibits abusive spouses from purchasing or possessing guns, this protection does not apply to people in dating relationships or convicted stalkers.
And as a result, American women are at a significantly greater risk of losing their lives to gun violence than women in any other high-income country.
Hillary's plan
With one group estimating more than 10,000 already killed by gun violence this year alone, it's time to demand more than thoughts and prayers from our elected officials. That's why Hillary's plan lays out concrete steps to make sure guns don't fall into the wrong hands while respecting the rights of responsible gun owners.
Putting this plan into action won't be easy, especially if Congress refuses to act. But Hillary believes some fights are too important to give up on—and this is one of them.

Hillary recently announced her plan to reform Wall Street, address dangerous risks in our financial system, and—here comes a really big one—prevent another financial crisis. We sat down with our colleagues Mike Shapiro and Mike Schmidt from the economic policy squad (known around the office as ""the Economikes"") to talk about what her plan would do—and why this issue is so important.
Q. So before we start, where did ""the Economikes"" come from?
Schmidt: Did you come up with that, Shapiro?
Shapiro: I mean, we're both named Mike, we both work on economic policy. So ... Economikes.
Q. Describe Hillary Clinton's Wall Street reform agenda in five words or fewer.
Schmidt: More accountability, tougher rules, stronger enforcement. Wait, that's six words.
Shapiro: So I can do it in five. Ready? Wall Street working for Main Street.
Schmidt: That was pretty good.
Yours was six words too. You know, for numbers guys ...
Schmidt: We're off to a really good start.
Shapiro: Well, we tried.
Schmidt: How about this? Less risk, more accountability.
Shapiro: Oh, that's good. That'll work.
Q. Why does Wall Street need to be reformed?
Schmidt: In 2008 we had a devastating financial crisis. It caused $13 trillion of wealth to disappear. It caused millions of families to lose their homes and 9 million workers to lose their jobs. We're still recovering. And Secretary Clinton believes that there are a couple of fundamental lessons that we can draw from that experience. The first is that risk on Wall Street can have devastating consequences for hardworking American families—again, our economy lost 9 million jobs.
And the second lesson is that you need tough and smart regulations for the financial sector. There was a general philosophy before the crisis that said that financial crises were a thing of the past, that large financial institutions could more-or-less regulate themselves. That was a damaging philosophy, and it was squarely rejected in the aftermath of the crisis.
So what happened? The Obama administration enacted the Dodd-Frank Act in July of 2010. And the Dodd-Frank Act took a number of really important steps. But Secretary Clinton believes that there's more to do to protect Main Street from risks on Wall Street. There's more to do to ensure that bad actors in the financial sector are held accountable. There's more to do to protect American consumers and investors from unfair and deceptive practices. So Secretary Clinton's plan is a comprehensive approach to creating less risk and more accountability.
Q. Not to put too fine a point on it, but what is Dodd-Frank?
Schmidt: Dodd-Frank is the bill that Congress passed and President Obama signed after the financial crisis. What it did is it looked at the crisis and said, you know, we don't want this to happen again. We need a safer, stronger financial system. And it took a number of measures to make that happen.
For example, it established a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This was Senator Warren's conception—she wrote an article in Democracy Journal that suggested we have an agency that focused solely on protecting American consumers from unfair and deceptive practices. That is what the CFPB has done, and it has helped millions of consumers. The CFPB is just an awesome achievement, and it's one that Secretary Clinton is committed to defending.
Dodd-Frank also said if you're a big bank that poses more risk to the system because of your size, you're not just going to get normal bank regulation—on top of that, you're going to have to be subject to a stronger set of constraints. So now the biggest financial institutions have stronger, what I like to call, shock absorbers. If something goes wrong, there is more there to ensure that they don't fail and that they don't bring the whole economy down with them in the event they fail.
And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Dodd-Frank strengthened regulation of derivatives and shadow banking, gave the government new tools to wind down big failing firms, and more.
Barney Frank himself has actually been out talking about our plan.
Shapiro: Yeah, he's been advising us, we've been talking to him.
He seems fun.
Schmidt: He's awesome. He's the man.
Q. How important is this policy compared to other policies Hillary has announced?
Schmidt: Extremely important.
Hillary talks about her plan to raise incomes for hardworking Americans at The New School in New York.
Shapiro: It's one of the most important economic policies that she will put forward on this campaign. People should understand that this is not a new issue for Secretary Clinton. She was representing New York at the beginning of the financial crisis, and she went to Wall Street and warned about some of the practices that led to the crisis. She talked about it during the 2008 campaign. And as this campaign was starting, one of the first things she did was demand an aggressive and robust plan for financial sustainability and making sure that we're taking on risks and holding people accountable. This plan is the result of months of effort, and talking to people who maybe disagree with us and think there are other ways to do this, people who have experience as regulators, people who advocate for consumers. Her team basically turned over every stone and working really hard for months, because this is such an important priority.
Schmidt: Hillary Clinton has defined the central economic challenge of her time as raising incomes for middle-class Americans. This is central to Secretary Clinton's economic vision because it's not just that we need to make the investments and have a fair tax code and all that to get wages rising—it's also that we can't let risk from the financial sector wipe that all away.
Q. When you talk about ""risk,"" what exactly are you talking about?
Schmidt: Let's be clear about something: We want an economy where people are taking risks, right? The entrepreneur who decides to start a business is taking a massive risk, and that entrepreneur is the same person who might build some of the greatest companies in America, employ thousands of people, drive wages up, and improve our standard of living. And we want a financial system that really fuels that kind of responsible risk-taking.
Shapiro: We want to kind of create an economy that works for exactly the type of entrepreneurship that Mike's talking about. We need to contain risks that don't help our economy. But it's also important to remember the economic logic of policies like the Affordable Care Act, paid leave, and child care: it enables families and hardworking Americans who want to go start a small businesses or who want to maybe go back to school to be able to take those risks, to try to get ahead without worrying about their health insurance coverage, or care for their children.
Q. What makes Hillary's plan different from other plans to fix Wall Street?
Shapiro: There might be different approaches that different people in the Democratic Party have put forward, but one thing we all agree on that we need to take on excessive risks in the financial system and hold people accountable for financial fraud and misdeeds.
If you listen to what the Republicans are saying, a lot of them want to get rid of Dodd-Frank. And there are active efforts underway by Republicans in Congress to try and roll it back. So the most important difference among the plans is that we Democrats agree that we need to build on and strengthen Dodd-Frank and go further, and Republicans want to get rid of the crucial protections that we've seen, even in the wake of a financial crisis that was devastating for American families.
Q. What can Hillary's plan do to change the culture that has led to this problem? Or if not change the culture, at least punish people who continue to act badly.
Schmidt: Secretary Clinton believes fundamentally that the vast majority of people in finance are hardworking, law-abiding people. But there are people who break the law and compromise the public's trust in our markets. So Secretary Clinton has a set of proposals aimed at increasing individual accountability. For example, she wants to enhance whistleblower rewards so good people have an incentive to come forward and kinda flag illegal activity. And on top of that, she's said that none of this is going to be possible if we continue to under-resource our prosecutors and regulators.
But Secretary Clinton is also proposing mechanisms that say, you know what, even if as a supervisor you weren't involved with a problem, you didn't engage in wrongdoing yourself, we should have a regulatory regime in place where you feel some consequences if really bad stuff happens on your watch—for example, by having it affect your pay.
Q. You guys seem to know this policy inside and out. Do you, like, have favorite footnotes?
Schmidt: Do I have a favorite footnote? That's a really good question.
Shapiro: That's a REALLY good question.
It is?
Schmidt: Footnote 13 is pretty substantive.
Q. Bottom line: What is the problem that you're trying to solve, and how does this policy solve it?
Schmidt: The problem that we're trying to solve is that excessive risk-taking in the financial sector can devastate the real economy. And we're trying to solve it by taking a comprehensive approach to addressing excessive risks in the financial system, so that we are encouraging the financial system to fuel the type of long-term investment that drives broad based-based economic growth and raises middle class incomes.
Shapiro: Americans shouldn't have to worry when they're putting their savings away that that could all go away in a massive financial crisis like the one we saw in 2008. We cannot have an economy that allows those risks to everyday American families to persist. So we are going to hold people accountable and take on those risks, to make sure that doesn't happen again.

Over her decades-long career in public service, Hillary has taken on her share of tough fights. Here are just a few of the biggest things she's accomplished.
1. Fought for children and families for 40 years and counting.
After law school, Hillary could have gone to work for a prestigious law firm, but took a job at the Children's Defense Fund. She worked with teenagers incarcerated in adult prisons in South Carolina and families with disabled children in Massachusetts. It sparked a lifelong passion for helping children live up to their potential.
2. Helped provide millions of children with health care.
As first lady of the United States, Hillary fought to help pass health care reform. When that effort failed, she didn't give up: Hillary worked with Republicans and Democrats to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program. CHIP cut the uninsured rate of American children by half, and today it provides health care to more than 8 million kids.
3. Helped get 9/11 first responders the health care they needed.
When terrorists attacked just months after Hillary became U.S. senator from New York, she worked to make sure the 9/11 first responders who suffered lasting health effects from their time at Ground Zero got the care they needed.
4. Told the world that ""women's rights are human rights.""
Standing in front of a U.N. conference and declaring that ""women's rights are human rights"" was more controversial than it sounds today. Many within the U.S. government didn't want Hillary to go to Beijing. Others wanted her to pick a less polarizing topic (you say polarizing, we say half the population). But Hillary was determined to speak out about human rights abuses, and her message became a rallying cry for a generation.
5. Stood up for LGBT rights at home and abroad.
As secretary of state, Hillary made LGBT rights a focus of U.S. foreign policy. She lobbied for the first-ever U.N. Human Rights Council resolution on human rights and declared that ""gay rights are human rights."" And here at home, she made the State Department a better, fairer place for LGBT employees to work.
6. Helped expand health care and family leave for military families.
Hillary worked across the aisle to expand health care access for members of the National Guard and reservists—making sure those who served and their families had access to health care when they returned home. And she worked to expand the Family Medical Leave Act, allowing families of those wounded in service to their country to take leave in order to care for their loved ones.
7. Negotiated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
As our nation's chief diplomat, Hillary didn't back down when the stakes were high. As Hamas rockets rained down on Israel, Hillary went to the region immediately. Twenty-four hours after she landed, a ceasefire went into effect—and that year became Israel's quietest in a decade.

And his second.
Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton met at Yale Law School—and she made the first move.
""I was studying in the library, and Bill was standing out in the hall talking to another student ... . I noticed that he kept looking over at me. He had been doing a lot of that. So I stood up from the desk, walked over to him and said, ?If you're going to keep looking at me, and I'm going to keep looking back, we might as well be introduced. I'm Hillary Rodham.' That was it.""
They even joined the mock trial team together.
Recognize that guy in the back row?
After graduation, Hillary moved to Washington, D.C. Bill moved back home to Arkansas. They visited each other often.
Hillary and Bill playing volleyball in the summer of 1975.
Bill had to ask Hillary to marry him three times before she said yes.
""I actually turned him down twice when he asked me to marry him. He asked me in England on a trip after law school graduation. I said, you know, I can't say yes. I feel too badly. And then about a year later he asked me again, and I said no. He said I'm not asking you again until you're ready to say yes.""
(Spoiler alert: She eventually did.)
They got married in their living room in Fayetteville, Arkansas.
""We were married in the living room on October 11, 1975, by the Reverend Vic Nixon. ... I wore a lace-and-muslin Victorian dress I had found shopping with my mother the night before. When I walked into the room on my father's arm, and the minister said, ?Who will give away this woman?' We all looked at my father expectantly. But he didn't let go. Finally, Rev. Nixon said, ?You can step back now, Mr. Rodham.'""
"" We started a conversation on our first date in the Spring of 1971, and more than thirty years later, he's still the best company I know.""

There was a presidential race going on back then, and I was sent by the Democratic National Committee to register Texas voters. So I came down here for the summer with my boyfriend. ? And I've got to tell you, Bill and I fell in love with South Texas. We ate a lot of green enchiladas at Mi Tierra. We drank our share of Shiner Bocks.

Here's Why,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116892,Hillary Clinton,"There's a reason (or seven) the world's leaders think Hillary was one of the all-time greats as secretary of state.
She's been called one of the finest secretaries of state we've ever had.
And someone who once held the same job as Hillary Clinton—former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright—says she's never met anyone more prepared to be president.
We asked world leaders what made Hillary's four years as America's chief diplomat so consequential. Here's what they had to say.
1. She restored America's reputation in the world.
In 2009, our credibility overseas had been badly damaged after years of unpopular American-led wars in the Middle East. Hillary went to work to restore America's reputation around the world. She visited 112 countries, brought smart power—coupling diplomacy with the threat of force or sanctions—to U.S. foreign policy, and shaped the global conversation ""through her engagement with so many leaders but also the caliber of her intellect,"" says former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard.
2. She championed the rights of women and girls around the world.
""Hillary knew in her head that if we wanted to build peaceful, economically prosperous nations, then we have to educate girls,"" says Prime Minister Gillard. Hillary worked to bring down barriers that stop women and girls from reaching their potential—standing up against sex trafficking; helping women gain access to markets, credit, and training; and leading the fight for a U.N. Security Council resolution to combat sexual violence against women and children in conflict zones.
3. She negotiated the toughest sanctions Iran has ever faced.
With Iran at risk of becoming a nuclear nation, Hillary played a critical role persuading Russia, China, and nine other U.N. Security Council countries to impose the toughest sanctions in Iranian history. It was ""a remarkable effort,"" says former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. ""And it paid off.""
4. She negotiated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
In 2012, conflict between Israel and Hamas was escalating in Gaza, and another war in the Middle East seemed imminent. Hillary flew to Jerusalem, convening meetings with leaders in Ramallah and Cairo, and in 24 hours negotiated a ceasefire—ushering in the quietest year Israel had seen in a decade.
5. She stood up for LGBT rights.
Hillary's boldness in standing up to countries that pushed anti-gay legislation ""transform[ed] the way countries perceive and react to homosexuality,"" in the words of one U.N. official. And when she declared to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that gay rights are human rights, commentators called her words ""the strongest defense ever in terms of gay rights.""
6. She reinvigorated American diplomacy with Asia.
Hillary renewed the United States' relationships with Asian and Pacific nations, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia. ""That's going to be remembered for many, many long years to come as a diplomatic breakthrough for the U.S.,"" says Prime Minister Gillard.
7. She took on the global HIV/AIDS pandemic.
During Hillary's tenure, the U.S. extended antiretroviral therapy—which helps HIV/AIDS patients live longer, healthier lives—to 78 countries. Dr. Eric Goosby, a U.N. public health official, says that action alone is helping to save the lives of millions of people around the world. And it's bringing us one big step closer to achieving an AIDS-free generation.

But here's what you might not know: The Iran Deal has its roots in Hillary Clinton's hard work as secretary of state, when she twisted arms in the international community to impose the strongest-ever international sanctions on Iran.
The Iran nuclear threat
Iran had been working for years under the Bush administration to develop the technology to build a nuclear weapon?a terrifying prospect for neighbors like Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the West. By 2009, Iran was racing toward its goal—and a lot of Western nations felt powerless to stop them.
When President Obama took office and asked Hillary to serve as secretary of state, countering Iran's nuclear program was one of their top priorities. They worked together to craft a two-pronged strategy: pressure and engagement. But the Iranians rejected every attempt at engagement, while they continued to defy the international community by enriching uranium in pursuit of a nuclear weapon.
So President Obama and Hillary devised a plan to ratchet up pressure on Iran by increasing its military presence in the region—including an additional aircraft carrier, a battleship, and top-notch radar and missile defense systems. Meanwhile, Hillary pushed for international sanctions, including economic penalties aimed at Iran's energy and financial sectors, through the U.N. Security Council.
But the stakes were high: If they failed, it could lead to military action.
What did Hillary do to get sanctions passed?
In order to put the sanctions in place, Hillary had to get nine of 15 countries in the U.N. Security Council to agree. Russia and China presented a big challenge: Both nations agreed Iran shouldn't be allowed to have nuclear weapons, but they weren't willing to do anything about it. And as permanent members of the U.N Security Council, they had the power to veto any deal.
So Hillary got to work.
"" It was tricky to say the least. It reminded me of backroom negotiations in the Senate, with all the horse trading, arm-twisting, vote counting, and hardball politics that go into passing major legislation.""
China was the key vote. Hillary knew that if the U.S. could convince Beijing to vote for sanctions, the rest of the Security Council would follow. Hillary, President Obama, and U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice were all in talks with Chinese officials—and they finally came to an initial agreement.
Here comes a plot twist: In May 2010, Iran made its own agreement with two Security Council members. Brazil and Turkey agreed to let Iran keep enriching uranium. That was unacceptable to the U.S. and its allies—and it put the agreement that Hillary had been working on with China at risk.
Hillary wasn't ready to give up. She flew to China and made the case to leaders about what sanctions would mean for stability in the Middle East, a steady flow of oil, and a good relationship between China and the U.S. Hillary's visit got the conversation back on track.
But they still weren't out of the woods until weeks later, when, in a spontaneous encounter in a Lima, Peru hotel bar, Hillary and the Chinese Ambassador to the United States reached a final agreement. China was finally on board.
Days later in New York, the U.N. Security Council passed the strictest, most effective sanctions on Iran in history.
Putting the pressure on Iran
Under President Obama's leadership, Hillary worked with Congress and the European Union to build on these multilateral sanctions and cut Iran off from the world's economic and financial system.
""One by one, we persuaded energy-hungry consumers of Iranian oil like India and South Korea to cut back. Soon, Iran's tankers sat rusting in port. Its economy was collapsing.""
The new measures were effective because they were global. The international campaign was so robust that Iran was no longer able to play one country off of another. The Iranian government suddenly had no choice but to negotiate.
What does this all have to do with the Iran Deal?
Hillary's diplomatic success laid the foundation for the Obama administration's recent Iran Deal. The unprecedented international sanctions delivered a blow to Iran's economy, forced them to the negotiating table, and gave the U.S. the leverage they needed to reach the deal.
The deal is the administration's best path to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The deal will give the United States access to Iran's nuclear facilities and allow us to monitor every aspect of their nuclear program. If Iran violates the agreement, we'll have enough warning to respond decisively. As president, Hillary will vigorously enforce the deal and make it one part of a broader regional strategy to counter Iran's other malicious behavior.

Hillary Clinton's appearance before the House Select Committee on Benghazi is underway.
Here's what she had to say about the four men who lost their lives at the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012—and how we can make sure a tragedy like this never happens again.
Thank you Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Cummings, members of the committee. The terrorist attacks at our diplomatic compound and later, at the CIA post in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012, took the lives of four brave Americans: Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods.
I am here to honor the service of those four men, the courage of the Diplomatic Security agency and the CIA officers who risked their lives that night, and the work their colleagues do every single day all over the world.
I knew and admired Chris Stevens. He was one of our nation's most accomplished diplomats. Chris's mother liked to say that he had sand in his shoes, because he was always moving, always working, especially in the Middle East that he came to know so well.
When the revolution broke out in Libya, we named Chris as our envoy to the opposition. There was no easy way to get him into Benghazi to begin gathering information and meeting those Libyans who were rising up against the murderous the dictator Qadhafi, but he found a way to get himself there on a Greek cargo ship, just like a 19th-century American envoy. But his work was very much 21st-century hard-nosed diplomacy.
It is a testament to the relationships that he built in Libya that on the day following the awareness of his death, tens of thousands of Libyans poured into the streets in Benghazi. They held signs reading: ""Thugs don't represent Benghazi or Islam."" ""Sorry people of America, this is not the behavior of our Islam or our Prophet."" ""Chris Stevens, a friend to all Libyans.""
Although I didn't have the privilege of meeting Sean Smith personally, he was a valued member of our State Department family. An Air Force veteran, he was an Information Management officer, who had served in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague.
Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty worked for the CIA. They were killed by mortar fire at the CIA's outpost in Benghazi, a short distance from the diplomatic compound. They were both former Navy SEALs and trained paramedics with distinguished records of service, including in Iraq and Afghanistan.
As secretary of state, I had the honor to lead and the responsibility to support nearly 70,000 diplomats and development experts across the globe.
Losing any one of them, as we did in Iraq, Afghanistan, Mexico, Haiti, and Libya during my tenure, was deeply painful for our entire State Department and USAID family, and for me personally.
I was the one who asked Chris to go to Libya as our envoy. I was the one who recommended him to be our ambassador to the president.
After the attacks, I stood next to President Obama as Marines carried his casket and those of the other three Americans off the plane at Andrews Air Force Base.
I took responsibility. And, as part of that, before I left office, I launched reforms to better protect our people in the field and help reduce the chance of another tragedy happening in the future.
What happened in Benghazi has been scrutinized by a nonpartisan, hard-hitting Accountability Review Board, seven prior congressional investigations, multiple news organizations, and, of course, our law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
So today I would like to share three observations about how we can learn from this tragedy and move forward as a nation.
First, America must lead in a dangerous world, and our diplomats must continue representing us in dangerous places.
The State Department sends people to more than 270 posts in 170 countries around the world.
Chris Stevens understood that diplomats must operate in many places where our soldiers do not, where there are no other boots on the ground, and safety is far from guaranteed. In fact, he volunteered for just those assignments.
He also understood we will never prevent every act of terrorism or achieve perfect security, and that we inevitably must accept a level of risk to protect our country and advance our interests and values.
And make no mistake: The risks are real. Terrorists have killed more than 65 American diplomatic personnel since the 1970s and more than a hundred contractors and locally employed staff.
Since 2001, there have been more than 100 attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities around the world.
But if you ask our most experienced ambassadors, they'll tell you they can't do their jobs for us from bunkers.
It would compound the tragedy of Benghazi if Chris Stevens' death and the death of the other three Americans ended up undermining the work to which he and they devoted their lives.
We have learned the hard way when America is absent, especially from unstable places, there are consequences. Extremism takes root, aggressors seek to fill the vacuum, and security everywhere is threatened, including here at home.
That's why Chris was in Benghazi. It's why he had served previously in Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jerusalem during the second intifada.
Nobody knew the dangers of Libya better—a weak government, extremist groups, rampant instability. But Chris chose to go to Benghazi because he understood America had to be represented there at that pivotal time.
He knew that eastern Libya was where the revolution had begun and that unrest there could derail the country's fragile transition to democracy. And if extremists gained a foothold, they would have the chance to destabilize the entire region, including Egypt and Tunisia.
He also knew how urgent it was to ensure that the weapons Qadhafi had left strewn across the country, including shoulder-fired missiles that could knock an airplane out of the sky, did not fall into the wrong hands. The nearest Israeli airport is just a day's drive from the Libyan border.
Above all, Chris understood that most people, in Libya or anywhere, reject the extremists' argument that violence can ever be a path to dignity or justice. That's what those thousands of Libyans were saying after they learned of his death. He understood there was no substitute for going beyond the Embassy walls and doing the hard work of building relationships.
Retreat from the world is not an option. America cannot shrink from our responsibility to lead. That doesn't mean we should ever return to the go-it-alone foreign policy of the past, a foreign policy that puts boots on the ground as a first choice rather than a last resort. Quite the opposite.
We need creative, confident leadership that harnesses all of America's strengths and values. Leadership that integrates and balances the tools of diplomacy, development, and defense.
And at the heart of that effort must be dedicated professionals like Chris Stevens and his colleagues, who put their lives on the line for a country—our country—because they believed—as I do—that America is the greatest force for peace and progress the world has ever known.
My second observation is this: We have a responsibility to provide our diplomats with the resources and support they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible.
After previous deadly attacks, leaders from both parties and both branches of government came together to determine what went wrong and how to fix it for the future. That's what happened during the Reagan administration, when Hezbollah attacked our embassy. They killed 63 people, including 17 Americans. And then in a later attack attacked our Marine barracks and killed so many more. Those two attacks in Beirut resulted in the deaths of 258 Americans.
It's what happened during the Clinton administration when al Qaeda bombed our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing more than 200 people, wounding more than 2,000 people, and killing 12 Americans. It's what happened during the Bush administration after 9/11.
Part of America's strength is we learn, we adapt, and we get stronger.
After the Benghazi attacks, I asked Ambassador Thomas Pickering, one of our most distinguished and longest-serving diplomats, along with Admiral Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appointed by President George W. Bush, to lead an Accountability Review Board. This is an institution that the Congress set up after the terrible attacks in Beirut. There have been 18 previous Accountability Review Boards. Only two have ever made any of their findings public. The one following the attacks on our embassies in East Africa and the one following the attack on Benghazi. The Accountability Review Board did not pull a single punch. They found systemic problems and management deficiencies in two State Department bureaus.
And the Review Board recommended 29 specific improvements. I pledged that by the time I left office, every one would be on the way to implementation. And they were. More Marines were slated for deployment to high-threat embassies. Additional Diplomatic Security agents were being hired and trained.
And Secretary Kerry has continued this work. But there is more to do. And no administration can do it alone. Congress has to be our partner, as it has been after previous tragedies.
For example, the Accountability Review Board and subsequent investigations have recommended improved training for our officers before they deploy to the field. But efforts to establish a modern joint training center are being held up by Congress. The men and women who serve our country deserve better.
Finally, there is one more observation I'd like to share.
I traveled to 112 countries as secretary of state. Every time I did, I felt great pride and honor representing the country that I love. We need leadership at home to match our leadership abroad. Leadership that puts national security ahead of politics and ideology.
Our nation has a long history of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy and national security. Not that we always agree—far from it—but we do come together when it counts.
As secretary of state, I worked with the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to pass a landmark nuclear arms control treaty with Russia. I worked with Republican leader Senator Mitch McConnell to open up Burma, now Myanmar, to find democratic change.
I know it's possible to find common ground, because I have done it.
We should debate on the basis of fact, not fear. We should resist denigrating the patriotism or loyalty of those with who we disagree.
So I am here. Despite all the previous investigations and all the talk about partisan agendas, I am here to honor those we lost and to do what I can to aid those who serve us still.
And my challenge to you, members of this committee, is the same challenge I put to myself.
Let's be worthy of the trust the American people have bestowed upon us. They expect us to lead. To learn the right lessons. To rise above partisanship and to reach for statesmanship.
That's what I tried to do every day as secretary of state. And it's what I hope we all strive for here today and into the future. Thank you.

Here's What You Need To Know,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116975,Hillary Clinton,"The Benghazi Committee, explained.
Hillary is on Capitol Hill today, testifying in front of the House Select Benghazi Committee. Here's what it's all about.
What happened in Benghazi
On September 11, 2012, a group of Islamic militia members attacked a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya. Four Americans were killed in the terrorist attack: U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods.
For Hillary, who was serving as secretary of state at the time, the tragedy is personal. She was the one who had asked the late Chris Stevens to serve as ambassador to Libya. She was with President Obama at Andrews Air Force Base when Marines brought home the caskets of the four Americans. Anyone who knows Hillary knows she isn't the kind of person to stand around wringing her hands after a tragedy—she leapt into action immediately to prevent anything like this from ever happening again.
The Benghazi Committee is the eighth—yes, eighth—congressional review of the tragedy.
The events in Benghazi have been scrutinized by countless panels, news organizations, and government agencies. After the attack, Hillary set up a nonpartisan panel known as the Accountability Review board (ARB) to investigate. The panel made dozens of recommendations for improvement. By the time Hillary left office, every single reform was on its way to being implemented.
After the ARB, seven congressional panels have also completed investigations. Five were led by Republicans. None found any wrongdoing. But even with these conclusive findings, House Republicans approved an unlimited budget—yup, we're talking about your taxpayer dollars—for an eighth congressional review. Enter the House Select Benghazi Committee.
The House Select Benghazi Committee has one goal.
Now, if you're wondering why Republicans are still at it even after the thorough reviews—or if you're thinking that sounds a little fishy—you're onto something. Over the past few weeks, a number of key Republicans—from House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to New York's Rep. Richard Hanna—have copped to the truth about why this committee was established in the first place: to ""go after"" Hillary Clinton and to hurt her presidential candidacy. A whistleblower has even come forward to say that he was fired because he ?objected to how partisan the inquiry was.
Trey Gowdy, the chair of the committee, has predicted the probe will continue well into 2016. Their aim is clear: hurt Hillary's chances of winning the presidential election. And for those of you who are curious, no, the committee has not been able to produce any new facts about the attack.
What you'll hear today
"" No one wants to find out what happened more than I do.""Hillary, October 24, 2012
Hillary's first priority is to get to the bottom of what happened in Benghazi. That's the right thing to do—and the way to make sure it doesn't happen again. That's why she has already testified on Capitol Hill about the tragedy (twice, in fact), and she has been asking to testify before the this committee for more than a ?year so that the public can hear her answers.
Republicans, on the other hand, are going to exploit whatever they can to mislead voters about Hillary's record. They'll grill her about emails and anything else they can think of to discredit her.
But here's what Hillary is going to do: stay focused, clarify the facts, and offer some lessons that we can learn to protect Americans going forward. The men and women who serve our country deserve nothing less.

Hillary has never been afraid to speak her mind, especially when it comes to defending women and girls. At the Democratic National Committee's Women's Leadership Forum this morning, she didn't hold back. Here are three of her most powerful quotes:
1. Anyone who is sick of Hillary standing up for women had better get ready for a long campaign.
2. She said something women have known for years.
3. And she called out GOP hypocrisy.

Republican candidates took the stage last night for their third presidential debate of the primary season. In between barbs, they trotted out talking points that all boiled down to one thing: Their agenda will hurt the middle class.?
We took the liberty of translating what they said into what they actually meant.
Thanks to President Obama, we've imposed tough new rules on Wall Street to prevent another crash. But Republicans have made it clear they want to weaken reforms and bring back the old and dangerous practices that led to the worst economic crisis in a generation. Many of the GOP candidates have promised to repeal Dodd-Frank, code for deregulating Wall Street.
Remember the days when you could be denied health coverage for a pre-existing condition? When insurance companies could put a lifetime cap on benefits and women could be charged more for coverage than men? The Republicans have either forgotten or they just don't care. Repealing the ACA would take us back to those days—and put the health care of millions in jeopardy. And yet, every GOP candidate is in favor of doing just that.
Rubio wants to talk about his tax plan? Well, the reviews are in and Rubio's tax plan would ""largely favor the 1 percent"". And he isn't alone. The Republican candidates are (once again) pushing the economic vision that wrecked our economy and and cost 9 million Americans their jobs. Despite attempts to dress up their recycled proposals with new buzzwords, they're essentially proposing ""trickle-down"" economics—a system that only benefits the wealthy and big corporations (and, as Hillary once put it, is one of the worst ideas from the '80s, ""right up there with New Coke, shoulder pads, and big hair."")
For people who claim to hate big government, Republicans sure enjoy interfering in women's private health decisions. Each year, 2.7 million patients rely on Planned Parenthood for cancer screenings, birth control, and other preventive care—one in five women has relied on the organization for health care in her lifetime. So when Republicans say they want to ""defund Planned Parenthood""—as nearly all of the GOP candidates have—they're talking about cutting people off from quality health care.
Donald Trump might be the face of anti-immigrant policies, but the truth is, there isn't much daylight between Trump and the other Republican candidates when it comes to immigration. In fact, none of the leading candidates have consistently supported a pathway to citizenship. And like Trump, they would even risk separating families by repealing President Obama's executive actions.
Last night's GOP debate may have been light on new ideas, but it wasn't light on bad ones.

Over the past few years, the African American community has publicly endured brutality after brutality, both in South Carolina and across the nation. As a South Carolinian, an African American man, and a father, I can't stop asking myself once again: Where does my community go from here?
How do we fix the problems that keep us up at night?
I was born and raised in South Carolina. I've spent my life here, fighting to make things better in my community. I joined Hillary's campaign because of that fight.
This week, I watched in horror as a young black woman—a student at Spring Valley High School, here in my home state—was forcibly removed from her desk, thrown to the ground, and dragged across a classroom by a deputy sheriff twice her size.
The silence in that classroom spoke volumes to me. A culture of fear must have been created among these students, their teacher, and the officer. Such a fear should not exist in a place of learning.
No school should ever have a culture like this. Students deserve the right to get an education without being afraid of the very people who are put in place to protect them.
"" Students deserve the right to get an education without being afraid of the very people who are put in place to protect them.""
In the days since the video went viral, people have been talking about what we can do to make sure something like this never happens again—but over the past few years, that conversation has started to become commonplace. We've heard it repeated over and over again, ebbing and flowing as new acts of violence against the black community come to light.
Those words are no longer enough.
We can—and should—talk about police brutality, improving community policing, changing the culture of police forces, and finding ways to erase officer bias. But those conversations can't take the place of instituting real and tangible changes.
We have to act.
It terrifies me that my son could one day be brutalized by an authority figure for refusing to leave a classroom, arrested for correcting a wrong, or pulled over and killed because he fits a description. And I know that I am far from the only person losing sleep worrying about my child and family.
When this campaign first launched, Hillary said she was going to make sure her campaign addressed those issues that aren't making headlines but are keeping families up at night. She is working to close the school-to-prison pipeline, end the era of mass incarceration, confront institutional racism, and fight to prevent gun violence.
So where do we go from here?
We continue to press forward, changing things once and for all. We stop talking about ensuring nothing like this happens again and actually create and enforce policies that prevent these brutalities.
If we don't, this cycle will continue—and we simply cannot afford that.

Here's How We Fix That,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116799,Hillary Clinton,"Our criminal justice system is broken—but there are three things we can do right now to start changing that.
The United States has the highest prison population rate in the world: We have less than 5 percent of the world's populations, but nearly 25 percent of the world's prisoners.
It's clear our criminal justice system isn't just broken. It's in crisis. And there are three specific things we can do right now to start fixing it.
1. End racial profiling in America.
African Americans and Latinos are more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than white Americans. But when it comes to who is pulled over, searched, and arrested during a police stop, the nationwide racial disparities are starker than many people realize:
There's a term for this: racial profiling. It's demeaning, wrong, and unconstitutional. And it doesn't work. In fact, it makes our law enforcement less effective by distracting police officers from the clues that actually hint at criminal activity.
As Hillary says, ""Everyone in every community benefits when there is respect for the law, and when everyone in every community is respected by the law."" And prohibiting law enforcement officials at all levels from relying on race during investigations is an important first step toward building trust between police and the communities they serve.
2. End the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine.
Under current U.S. sentencing laws, the penalty for one gram of crack is equivalent to 18 times that much powder cocaine.
And what's more—there's no scientific basis for the distinction in sentencing. Crack is nearly identical to powder cocaine. The main difference is that African Americans tend to be the primary users and distributors of crack cocaine, while white Americans are more likely to use powder cocaine.
And that one disparity has caused the number of people behind bars—specifically African Americans—to skyrocket. Low-level, nonviolent drug offenders are serving longer sentences under mandatory minimum sentencing laws—which impose a strict number of years in prison for those convicted of using or distributing certain drugs.
The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 reduced the sentencing disparity from a whopping 100:1 to 18:1. Unsurprisingly, that led to a drop in the federal prison population. But until equal amounts of crack and powder cocaine—two forms of the exact same drug—carry equal sentences, African Americans will continue to be imprisoned at disproportionate rates.
Because many of the 2.4 million Americans currently in prison are non-violent, low-level offenders, ending this sentencing disparity will go a long way toward ending the era of mass incarceration.
3. ""Ban the box"" and give prisoners who did their time a fair shot at employment.
600,000 prisoners re-enter society every year. Up to 60 percent face long-term unemployment because many employers are reluctant to hire applicants with a criminal record, regardless of their qualifications. And in just about every area of the country, job applicants are required by law to disclose their criminal history.
In fact, applicants who disclose that they have a criminal history are half as likely to get an interview—and the odds are even worse for African Americans.
That little box on most job application forms creates barriers for people with a felony on their record—and getting rid of it will give them a fair chance to get work. Research shows that hiring managers are much more likely to hire applicants whom they meet and get to know before learning about their criminal record.
Of course, there are racial disparities in hiring that ""banning the box"" won't solve. But this would be an important step in the right direction: By banning the box and preventing federal employers and contractors from asking about criminal history at the application stage, 65 million Americans with criminal records could have a better chance at employment—and with it, a second chance.

For Gwen Carr and Maria Hamilton, reforming our criminal justice system is deeply personal.
Carr's son, Eric Garner, suffocated in police custody. Hamilton's son, Dontre, was shot 14 times. Both men were unarmed.
Carr and Hamilton have united with other mothers whose children have been killed, and together, they've turned their grief into a sweeping effort to reform our criminal justice system. Hillary traveled to Chicago to sit down with a group of these mothers to hear about their experiences and ideas. Afterward, Hillary and the mothers learned that a young child had been shot and killed just miles away—further underscoring the urgent need to take on the epidemic of violence that is devastating communities across the country.
We spoke with Carr and Hamilton after their meeting with Hillary.
Q. What was Dontre like?
Maria Hamilton: Dontre had the most beautiful smile. He loved his family. Fifteen minutes before he died, he called his brother, checking on me, to make sure that I was OK, to see if I had cooked. So I miss his presence, but I feel his spirit.
Q. If Eric was here today, what would you want him to know?
Gwen Carr: I will always be with him and for him until justice is served.
Q. Why is criminal justice reform so important to you?
GC: It became important to me since my son [Eric] died, because I have seen nothing yet. No accountability. They didn't indict the man who killed my son. It never even got to court. That day he was not committing any crime; he did not have a weapon. He was targeted.
I was at work when I started to hear about it, and when I got home and found out that my son had been murdered by police, it just took everything out of me. It went deep. They stole my heart; they ripped it out. I mean, my soul was crushed. He was my firstborn, and he didn't deserve that. And that day, I will never ever forget as long as I live.
Q. Maria, can you tell me your story?
MH: Dontre was 31 years old. Dontre went to go and rest in a park on a beautiful, sunny day, and his life was taken for being in that park. He made a manager at Starbucks uncomfortable with his presence, and she called the police to have him removed from the park. And he was beaten and shot 14 times. Broad daylight. We had 60 witnesses.
The district attorney decided not to indict. The Justice Department picked it up the same day at 3 p.m., December 23, two days before Christmas, and I still haven't gotten a response back.
It's been 22 months since I buried my son for just going to a park.
Q. How does it feel that you still have no answer?
MH: No mom should ever have to bury her son in this kind of tragedy. So we're going to continue to fight. We're going to continue to change laws. We're going to continue to challenge the people that take the offices and the seats to protect and serve this community.
Q. Why is criminal justice reform so urgent?
GC: These police officers that are getting away with murder, literally, have to stand accountable for their misconduct. And the only way that's going to happen is if their superiors make them stand accountable. Because it has to start from the top.
MH: Everybody needs to be accountable for their actions.
Q. A lot of the mothers [at today's meeting] spoke about how they didn't choose to be in this fight.
GC: No, we didn't.
But you're in it.
GC: If we let it go to the backburner, it will die and get swept under the rug like so many other cases. And we can't let it.
We have to keep our sons' legacies alive and keep reminding people that they died, and why they died, and that this should not happen again.
Q. What does it mean to you that Hillary is addressing these issues?
MH: When I first met Hillary, I felt her sympathy, and that's more than what I got from my governor. So it was warming to know that she wasn't just one of our leaders, she wasn't just a candidate running for president. She showed up as woman who's in a position to make real change, and she's taking an effort to see what's needed.
GC:?To me, it means that we now have a candidate that's paying attention. Because none of the other candidates have reached out to us in any way. And we need someone who's going to look at what we need. We need someone that's going to bring something to the table that's going to benefit us as a people. Because we don't just want someone in the White House that's gonna have a title. We need to resolve issues.
Q. What's one thing you want people to know about you and your family?
GC: That we are going to stand for justice. As long as we live, we are going to be out there, not only for our family and Eric, but for everyone. The nameless. The hopeless. The voiceless. We're going to be out there on the forefront. I was thrown into this, but I'm going to stay the course.
MH: We're fighters. And we're going to fight until we get some real change. I'm already working with my grandkids, I'm telling them, I'm allowing them to see what we're going through. So when they get to be adults, they'll know the justice system.
Q. How do you feel coming away from the meeting?
GC: I feel confident that if Hillary gets into office, we will have a fairer playing ground. And we'll try to make it happen for her. So, the meeting was positive.
MH: We're hoping that we can partner with Hillary to get some true change for all people. It's needed.

This Is My Story,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116820,Hillary Clinton,"I got to help make history.
When I was invited to emcee the launch of African Americans for Hillary, I was only nervous about one thing: finding the right outfit. I HAD to wear a pantsuit. What else does someone wear to meet THE pantsuit aficionado?
Unfortunately, pantsuit scouting is much harder than I thought. And if I was going to rock her look, I would have to do it perfectly. At the last minute, I abandoned my quest and settled on a dress that felt very Olivia Pope.
Arriving at Clark Atlanta, the HBCU where the event was held, felt like pulling up to a Weeknd concert. I couldn't believe the turnout—hours before the event was set to start the line was stretched a mile long! I got this feeling that I was taking part in something much bigger than the average speech.
I don't really remember what being onstage was like—it was a complete blur. But I do remember watching my community come together and stand up for Hillary. It felt powerful.
And then I got to actually meet her! It felt crazy—mostly because it didn't feel crazy at all. I thought that I would panic when I saw her, but she had this huge smile on her face, and when she hugged me I felt totally calm. I even asked her to recreate her famous ""dirt off your shoulders"" move—and she did!
Here she comes.. Brush your shoulders @HillaryClinton. #imwithher pic.twitter.com/KFHi4eAUWx— Karen Civil (@KarenCivil) October 30, 2015
Then I went backstage to watch the rest of the introductions and hear Hillary's speech. It felt so huge to me to see Monica, a person I have admired since I was a child, stand up and say ""this is our candidate, this woman is fighting us.""
With @MonicaBrown listening to Hillary's Speech on issues that effect the african american community. #ImWithHer pic.twitter.com/1c9stc9pu2— Karen Civil (@KarenCivil) October 30, 2015
When Hillary took the stage with Congressman John Lewis, the crowd exploded. Instantly, she began to dig deep into policy solutions, and ways the federal government can work on issues like police relations, college affordability, and job security.
When activists began chanting, she didn't try to silence them. She told them that she wants to talk about the issues they were raising. She didn't make them feel like they didn't belong. She still continued to carry on and she let them do the same. And eventually the crowd stepped in and said ""we want to hear Hillary speak on these issues.""
Watching her handle that moment made me feel even more sure that this is the woman we need leading our country. She showed respect to these activists that are trying to make things better for the black community in their own way. She didn't condescend to them, or shout them down, or do anything to make them feel like their voices weren't heard. She addressed their concerns, and then she continued talking about the things she had planned to talk about—the very things they were trying to bring attention to.
Recently, the debate over immigration, an issue that's very close to my heart, has been poisoned by some of the other people running. I am Haitian American. My parents and my family are immigrants from Haiti. Watching the immigrant community be torn down over these past few months has been incredibly hurtful. But Hillary has been there every step of the way, making sure that everyone in this country is shown the respect that they are owed, simply on the basis of their humanity. In person, Hillary's strength is undeniable, and while watching this speech I knew that she would stand up and fight for us on the full range of issues affecting our community, including the ones like immigration that people sometimes forget affect us too.
Participating in the launch of African Americans for Hillary felt like participating in a piece of history, and I hope I'll get the opportunity to see our future president again soon. I'm staying on the lookout for a good pantsuit, just in case.

It was a busy week—so here are a few stories, curated by Team Hillary, to get you up to speed over the weekend.
1. This week, Hillary wrote in?Ebony magazine about how we can strengthen communities of color in America.
2. Jimmy Kimmel asked Hillary what we should call the husband of a female president. She had a few ideas.
3. 18-year-old Texan Simone Biles became the most decorated woman gymnast of all time after winning her 10th World Champion gold medal—proving once again that girls can do anything.
4. And speaking of awesome women: Malala and Emma Watson weighed in on the U.S. presidential election.
5. Hillary continues to speak out about gun violence: ""This is a danger, a threat, everywhere in our country.""
6. And finally: Surprising no one, this analysis shows that the top 1 percent would benefit the most from Rubio, Trump, and Bush's tax plans.

Congressman John Lewis stood backstage in the auditorium at Clark Atlanta University, one of the oldest historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in Georgia, watching as excited students and members of the Atlanta community packed into the auditorium, ready to launch African Americans for Hillary. By his side stood one of his dearest friends, Hillary Clinton.
At age 19, John Lewis joined the Congress of Racial Equality freedom rides—and he's been tirelessly fighting for civil rights since. Lewis spoke at the March on Washington, and he endured unspeakable brutality marching from Selma to Montgomery protesting Alabama's oppressive voting laws.
One of the most severe beatings Lewis received happened in Anniston, Alabama, in 1961. When he and his fellow Freedom Riders arrived in Anniston, their bus was attacked, and many of the people on board were badly injured. Lewis was taken to the Anniston Regional Medical Center for treatment.
The name of the hospital might seem like an insignificant detail—but it mattered to Alexa Heard, a current senior at Clark Atlanta University, who was standing on stage introducing the pair in the wings.
""That day,"" said Heard, ""a bruised and beaten John Lewis, along with his fellow Freedom Riders, were taken to a local hospital called Regional Medical Center in Anniston. It was a segregated care facility at the time. But because he had gotten on that bus and rode into a world of unrighteousness, because he had fought against racism, armed only with truth, love, and the belief that all men truly are created equal, because he had suffered the sting of humiliation and indignity, because he had stood there, and he had stood for something, is the reason why I was able to be born in that hospital some 30 years later.""
Backstage, Hillary smiled brightly as she turned to the congressman. ""Ooh,"" she said, lightly squeezing his arm. ""That was a great line.""
Lewis smiled back at her.
Twenty-five years after that day in Anniston, the teenager who was beaten and arrested for standing up to racism was elected to Congress to represent Georgia—a state that had been deeply segregated for the first half of his life.
But in 2013, decades after African Americans were legally guaranteed the right to vote free from discrimination, he watched with horror as the Supreme Court removed key pieces of the Voting Rights Act of 1964—a law he had fought and bled for.
""That act helped free and liberate many Americans. The vote is the most powerful, most precious nonviolent tool that we have in a democratic society. And we have forces in America today that are trying to make it harder and more difficult for people to participate—we cannot let that happen.""
Hillary will fight to restore the Voting Rights Act and the rights that the Freedom Riders fought for: ensuring that no voice is silenced, no person is unfairly barred from voting, and no community is ignored in the political process.
""There are forces that are trying to take us back. Hillary Clinton is saying we will not go back, we will go forward and we will go with her,"" Lewis says. ""When things get tough, Hillary does not back down. ... She is a tireless fighter, an advocate for those that have been left out and left behind. She will fight to reform our broken criminal justice system. She will fight for each and every child to receive the best possible education. She is the right person for the job in the 21st century.""

248,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5002,"November 8, 2015",Press Release - Equal Pay For Women Isn't Just Fair—it's a Game Changer For the Economy. Here's Why,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116736,Hillary Clinton,"Women shouldn't make less than men in 2015. Period.
More women than ever are supporting their families, but on the whole we still get paid less than men.
And yet some Republicans deny it's a problem, or that a pay gap exists at all. Here's why they're wrong.
Do women really make less than men??
Yes. In 2013, women working full time, year-round had median earnings of $39,157—just 78% of what the median man made ($50,033). By that math, women have to work 60 extra days on average just to catch up to their male counterparts.
Source: The U.S. Census Bureau
It gets worse. Women of color often lose out even more.
*Based on median annual earnings of full time, year-round workers, age 16 and over
So, what causes the wage gap?
There are a lot of reasons for the gap, including the types of work women and men typically do. Women dominate fields like teaching and clerical work, which tend to pay less than male-dominated fields. Women are also the majority of low-wage and minimum-wage workers.
But there's a lot more to the story.?
Even within the same jobs, women often earn less than men. Hillary recently met a young man who told her that when he was 17, he had landed his first job as a cashier, working side-by-side with his mom. When he brought home his first paycheck, he discovered he was making a dollar more an hour after one week than his mom was making after doing the same job for four years.?
Stories like this are all too common. In some cases, they're about discrimination. But there are other, more subtle factors. Culture and gender norms influence what women study in school, the opportunities that are open to them, and how responsibilities at home affect their careers. And they're more likely than men to be hindered by outdated workplace policies.
How does the gender wage gap impact women?
Women are the primary or co-breadwinners in two-thirds of households with children under 18. When they make less than men, their families pay a price. In fact, research shows that if unmarried women with kids made as much as men, the poverty rate for their families would fall by almost half. ?
And when women lose out, our economy loses out, too.
Source: Institute for Women's Policy Research
This is awful. What can we do about it?
The good news is that we can shrink the gender pay gap by addressing some of the root causes. That's why Hillary is fighting for policies like:?
1. A higher minimum wage?
Women make up two-thirds of minimum wage and tipped workers—and nearly a quarter of these workers are women of color. A woman currently working full time, year round at the minimum wage will earn $14,500 annually, which is far below the poverty line for a mother with two children. Raising the minimum wage would help millions of families make ends meet, and go a long way toward closing the gender wage gap.?
2. The Paycheck Fairness Act?
It's tough for workers to fight discrimination if they don't know they're being paid unfairly. The Paycheck Fairness Act would allow millions of workers to discuss their compensation without the fear of losing their jobs or facing retaliation. It would also boost penalties for employers that violate equal pay laws.?
3. Paid family and medical leave?
The U.S. is currently the only country in the developed world without guaranteed paid leave of any kind. A whopping 25 percent of women surveyed by the Department of Labor reported going back to work within two weeks of having a baby because they have no paid leave. Others take unpaid time time off, resulting not only in the loss of a paycheck—but also in lower earnings in the future. Paid leave would help families—and especially women—get ahead.?
4. Quality, affordable child care?
Women are often held back from entering or advancing in the workforce because of the cost of childcare—which has shot up nearly 25 percent over the past decade. In many states, it's even higher than the average cost of college tuition. By investing in national child care, we can help women and men juggle work and parenting responsibilities.?
These policies wouldn't just go a long way toward achieving equal pay—they'd also lift families out of poverty and let businesses to attract and retain top talent, a win-win for our economy.

In 2015, race still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America—and who gets left behind. When one in three African American men will be behind bars in his lifetime, when voting rights are under attack, and when opportunity is increasingly hard to come by, we must fight to restore balance and fairness to our country.
Go behind the scenes during the launch of African Americans for Hillary in Atlanta, Charleston, and Chicago.
October 30: Atlanta, Georgia
After a powerful introduction from civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, Hillary took the stage at Clark Atlanta University—one of the many prominent HBCUs in the Atlanta community—to launch African Americans for Hillary. When protests began chanting ""black lives matter,"" Hillary agreed with them: ""Yes, they do, and I'm going to talk about that. ... We have to take action together.""
That day, she also met with religious leaders at the Rainbow PUSH Coalition Minister's Luncheon, where she had the unenviable task of following a speech given by Reverend Jesse Jackson, Sr.
October 30?31: Charleston, South Carolina
Hillary joined the Charleston Branch of the NAACP for a celebration of their 98 years—and a moving tribute to the victims of the Charleston massacre.
The next morning, the International Longshoremen's Association endorsed Hillary, with a strong showing from her friends at the International Association of Machinists.
November 2: Chicago, Illinois
The mothers of Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, Dontre Hamilton, Eric Garner, Frankie Valencia, Jordan Davis, Sandra Bland, Hadiya Pendleton, Terrell Bosley, and Blair Holt met with Hillary to discuss gun violence prevention and issues that affect their communities. While Hillary was meeting with the mothers, a 9 year old was killed by a stray bullet just across town, underscoring the urgency of addressing gun violence.
November 7: Orangeburg, South Carolina
NewsOne and Claflin University, an HBCU in South Carolina, hosted a town hall on issues affecting the African American community. Roland Martin, who moderated the event, even questioned Hillary on whether she would appoint an African American woman to the Supreme Court (she would) and her knowledge of the ""wobble"" (she's open to learning).

What does Veterans Day mean to those who have served and sacrificed? Here are a few of their thoughts:
""As an immigrant and the first person in my family to obtain a college degree and then a graduate degree, I cherish the freedom we have in this country. It has been an honor to serve with the brave men and women who keep our country safe, so that we may live free.""—Won Palisoul, U.S. Navy veteran and spouse of a veteran

""My family has consecutively served our nation in uniform since World War I. Service to our nation is imbued in all that I do. All that I am, and all that I have achieved, I owe to my service to our nation. I am and shall always be grateful for the opportunities my service provided me and the lifelong friends I gained along the way.""—Terron Sims, West Point graduate and Iraq War veteran

""When my husband was deployed in Iraq, I wrote an email every evening about the little everyday things that the kids and I did. We couldn't talk on the phone very often, but I knew when my husband had time he could read my emails and if he wanted to respond he could. I didn't write any complaints or say anything negative or stressful. Instead, I wrote about things that we would have talked about if he were home. He loved hearing about the funny things the kids did and said that day. It made him feel like he wasn't missing out on their daily lives. It was a cathartic experience for me to let him know what I was doing, thinking, and feeling at the time. It also helped our transition when he returned home because there wasn't a huge gap that we felt was missed between us.
""Deployments are difficult on the entire family. Communication is key to a strong family and marriage, especially during challenging times. Something as simple as our daily quick emails helped us to stay connected as we navigated through our time apart and transitioned back together again.""—Uma Chaudhary, U.S. Air Force spouse
Use of former military ranks or job titles does not imply endorsement by any of the Departments of the Military.

It was just so good.""
This is the story of how Becky, a woman from rural Winneshiek County, Iowa, bought Hillary Clinton a beer.
""My mother's name is Dorothy. Hillary's mother's name is Dorothy. They're both gone now—my mother died almost six years ago. Both women lived through the Great Depression, and that shaped their daughters.
""My mother wanted so much to vote for Hillary.""
Back in May, during Hillary's first listening tour through Iowa, Becky made Hillary a promise.
""In Decorah, there is a brewery called Toppling Goliath. They have some of the best beers in the world—you can look it up. And one of the beers they brew is called Dorothy's. When I met Hillary in Mason City a few months ago, I said, 'When you come to Decorah, I'd like to take you to Toppling Goliath Brewery. I will buy you a Dorothy's beer, and you and I can toast to our mothers.'""
And sure enough, a few months later, Hillary returned to speak in Decorah—and Becky was ready to follow through on her promise.
""We were standing in a room at Luther College before she spoke, and I had Dorothy's beer in a little blue cooler. I said ‘Hillary, I made you a promise when I visited with you in Mason City. I told you that both our mothers were named Dorothy.' And she had that look of realization. I said ‘I promised that if you came to Decorah, I'd buy you a beer named after our mothers. And I have done that! I have the beer!'
""So I got out two beers and I handed her one. I said: ‘Our mothers, named Dorothy, wanted to vote for this lady for president. And they didn't get a chance to. But I will. And here's to our mothers.'
""And we clinked our bottles of Dorothy beer and we held them high. It was just so good.
""We didn't drink them then—I had to go to her speech and she had to give her speech! But I left them there in the cooler for her to have one at the end of the day.""
To all the Dorothys out there: Cheers."

Donald Trump.
At the last Republican debate, Donald Trump's hateful rhetoric and backward policies reached a new low: He gushed about President Eisenhower's deportation policy—one of the most shameful periods in our country's history.
"" [Eisenhower] moved a million and a half illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border. They came back. Moved them again, beyond the border, they came back. Didn't like it. Moved them way south.""Donald Trump
Trump was referring to something called (seriously) Operation Wetback. And yes, it was an actual government initiative under President Eisenhower, which deported hundreds of thousands Mexican migrants—and in some cases U.S. citizens of Mexican descent—deep into Mexico under abhorrent circumstances. Some were left for dead. Others were abused and humiliated.
It's outrageous that a frontrunner of the Republican Party would point to this operation as an example of sound policy. But what's even worse is how Trump suggested executing it:
"" [Y]ou're going to have a deportation force ...""Donald Trump
A deportation force, charged with locating, apprehending, and deporting 11 million people? There are a few words for that in Spanish: Inhumano. Barb?rico. Cruel.

On a recent trip to New Hampshire, Hillary knew she could get a great cup of coffee at White Mountain Cafe in Gorham. What she didn't expect was that a five-minute stop would turn into an in-depth conversation about one of the most important issues of her campaign. What do you get when Hillary talks to people about their real problems and concerns? Real ideas.
It started when Hillary met a retired school nurse, who talked about the challenges she faced taking care of kids in the area—challenges that went beyond helping a sick child.
""I fed a lot of kids, I clothed a lot of kids. Putting Band-Aids on kids was just a little, teeny tiny part of my job. It was more making sure that they were ready to be there and learn. Because if they're hungry or tired or not supported, then they don't learn.""
Hillary asked if there was anything the school could do to make it better, and a high school teacher chimed in with some ideas about the kind of support that will help teachers help their students get a world-class education—from creating support networks for educators to helping them stay up-to-date on new teaching methods.
""Really what we want is that collaboration.""
One other important piece of the puzzle? All of that starts at the very beginning—just ask the early childhood educator who joined the conversation about what we can do in our kids' earliest years to prepare them for the future.
""We've got the research. It tells us early brain development is key.""
Before long, everyone was taking part in the conversation. And everyone agreed: There is nothing more important than helping our kids get off to the best possible start in life—and giving them an opportunity to succeed. It's an issue that's helped shape Hillary's life and career. And before she had to go to her next event, she was able to answer one important question.

Julia Rothman, a New York City?based artist, tackled the second Democratic debate of the 2016 election.
I am constantly drawing what's around me, things that happen to me, things I see, things I am thinking about. I wanted to draw the debate because it was just that—something important happening that I definitely needed to pay attention to. Hillary is a remarkable woman, and I am incredibly inspired by her tenacity. When I draw someone, I am completely focused on that person. This was a chance to really study her courage and determination—and understand her by observing her intensely.

I often find it very challenging to get a likeness. Last night I was very focused on her expressions, trying to capture her in a few different moments—talking about serious issues, and also laughing at the funny banter. And I ended up taking a lot of pictures of the television with my phone. That way I was able to draw from a few still shots while also watching at the same time. I drew in pencil first, which is unusual for me. I hardly ever sketch before, but I wanted to make sure my lines were right. Then I inked and painted in sections quickly.

I was very impressed by her confidence, her clear wording, and strong spirit. And overall, the sketches, to me, served as a documentation of her impassioned performance.

We can defeat global terrorism.
1. We need to crush ISIS on its home turf.?
We can't just contain ISIS—we need to defeat it. That means going after the group in Syria, Iraq, and across the Middle East. And it means ramping up airstrikes and making sure local and regional ground troops have what they need to go after ISIS and create safe spaces.
2. We need to disrupt and dismantle terrorist infrastructure—on the ground and online.
Old school tactics aren't going to cut it when it comes to defeating a terrorist group that has mastered the art of online propaganda. ISIS and global jihadists are recruiting, training, and inciting violence on social media—breeding a growing network of terrorists around the world. The U.S. needs to work with our partners around the world to be just as savvy.
3. We have to protect America and our allies.
We need better coordination and information-sharing all around to break up terror plots and prevent attacks—between European governments and law enforcement, between Silicon Valley and Washington, and between local police officers and the communities they serve.

One of Them Told Her Story,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116909,Hillary Clinton,"Nobody should go through life this way.
Imagine you come home from school to find that your parents aren't home.?
In a moment of panic, you wonder: Did they just run out to the store? Or were they taken?
Millions of kids live with this fear every day. Betsaida Frausto is one of them.
Betsaida is a 17-year-old. Her family lives with the constant fear of deportation.
Betsaida with her familia.
Families like Betsaida's are living with this fear and uncertainty every day.
President Obama took executive action to help young people who were brought to the US as children—and one year ago today, President Obama authorized ""DAPA"" (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents). But a federal court in Texas issued an injunction blocking the action. And many families who would have gotten relief from deportation are right back where they started: living in fear.
Betsaida's parents brought her to America so she could have a brighter futuro than they did. And so far, she has.
Betsaida participates in a magnet high school program, and has her sights set on attending one of the nation's top universities. She wants to become a doctor. She also founded Puerta Abierta, a support group for students whose families are at risk of deportation.
When the federal court put DAPA on hold, it was hard on Betsaida's family. For them, the immigration debate isn't just a sign of our country's political dysfunction—it's an emotional rollercoaster.
"" My dad had a bright future. He was going to open his own mechanic shop, he's currently a mechanic and he thought he was going to be able to expand his business. However, since the delay, he can't do anything with it.""Betsaida Frausto
One step forward, two steps back. Un paso para adelante, dos pasos para atr?s.
""I remember my family getting excited ... ,"" explains Betsaida, but with DAPA held up by the courts they can't leave the country, because they might not be allowed back in. For some families, this means being cut off from friends and family back home, not being able to visit a sick parent, or celebrate a relative's wedding.
Even if the Supreme Court rules in favor of DAPA, it expires in January of 2017, so its fate is in the hands of the next president. All of the Republican candidates have said they won't renew it.
A few months ago, Betsaida had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Last Spring, Hillary visited Betsaida's high school and sat down with DREAMers.?Betsaida had the chance to tell her family's story to a presidential candidate—one who listened, and even complimented Betsaida on her exceptional grades.
But for Betsaida, this was more than an opportunity to meet a role model. She and her family are paying close attention to our upcoming elections, because the stakes are incredibly high.
"" I want to do everything in my power not only to continue the executive orders that President Obama has put forth—DAPA and DACA and the kinds of changes that he has made... I will not be deporting parents. I will not be breaking up families. I will not be doing what we've seen too much of, which is trying to make immigrants the scapegoat for everything that people are concerned about in the country.""—Hillary Clinton, Rancho High School, May 5th 2015
Mientras, Betsaida will have to wait—and hope she doesn't one day return to an empty home.

Laura Rosenberger is one of Hillary's foreign policy experts. She'll be the first to tell you that nuance matters when talking about foreign policy—so she annotated Hillary's speech on how to defeat ISIS.
Thank you to Richard and thanks for the great work that the council does under your leadership. It truly is an important resource for us all. Fareed, I look forward to having the conversation with you, everyone here at the Council, and Mr. Mayor, thank you very much for being here and for everything you are doing and will do to keep our city safe and strong. I am very grateful.
I wanted to come here, to our city, which has shown such resilience in the face of terrorism, to talk about the events of the past week and the work we must do together to protect our country and our friends.
When the United States was hit on 9/11, our allies treated that attack against one as an attack against all. Now it is our turn to stand in solidarity with France and all of our friends. We cherish the same values, we face the same adversaries, we must share the same determination.
After a major terrorist attack, every society faces a choice between fear and resolve. The world's great democracies can't sacrifice our values or turn our backs on those in need. Therefore, we must choose resolve. And we must lead the world to meet this threat.
Now, let us be clear about what we are facing.
Beyond Paris, in recent days, we have seen deadly terrorist attacks in Nigeria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Turkey. And a Russian civilian airliner destroyed over the Sinai. At the heart of today's new landscape of terror is ISIS. They persecute religious and ethnic minorities, kidnap and behead civilians, murder children. They systematically enslave, torture, and rape women and girls.
ISIS operates across three mutually reinforcing dimensions: a physical enclave in Iraq and Syria, an international terrorist network that includes affiliates across the region and beyond, and an ideological movement of radical jihadism. We have to target and defeat all three.
And time is of the essence. ISIS is demonstrating new ambition, reach, and capabilities. We have to break the group's momentum and then its back. Our goal is not to deter or contain ISIS, but to defeat and destroy ISIS.
But we have learned that we can score victories over terrorist leaders and networks only to face metastasizing threats down the road. So we also have to play and win the long game.
We should pursue a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy—one that embeds our mission against ISIS within a broader struggle against radical jihadism that is bigger than any one group, whether it's al-Qaeda or ISIS or some other network. An immediate war against an urgent enemy and a generational struggle against an ideology with deep roots will not be easily be torn out. It will require sustained commitment and every pillar of American power. This is a worldwide fight—and America must lead it.
Our strategy should have three main elements. One, defeat ISIS in Syria, Iraq, and across the Middle East. Two, disrupt and dismantle the growing terrorist infrastructure that facilitates the flow of fighters, financing, arms, and propaganda around the world. Three, harden our defenses and those of our allies against external and homegrown threats.
Let me start with the campaign to defeat ISIS across the region. The United States and our international coalition have been conducting this fight for more than a year. It is time to begin a new phase and intensify and broaden our efforts to smash the would-be caliphate and deny ISIS control of territory in Iraq and Syria. That starts with a more effective coalition air campaign, with more allied planes, more strikes, and a broader target set. A key obstacle standing in the way is a shortage of good intelligence about ISIS and its operations.
So we need an immediate ""intelligence surge"" in the region, including technical assets, Arabic speakers with deep expertise in the Middle East, and even closer partnership with regional intelligence services. Our goal should be to achieve the kind of penetration we accomplished with al-Qaeda in the past. This would help us identify and eliminate ISIS's command and control and its economic lifelines. A more effective coalition air campaign is necessary, but not sufficient. And we should be honest about the fact that, to be successful, air strikes will have to be combined with ground forces actually taking back more territory from ISIS.
Like President Obama, I do not believe that we should again have a hundred thousand American troops in combat in the Middle East. That is just not the smart move to make here. If we have learned anything from 15 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is that local people and nations have to secure their own communities. We can help them and we should, but we cannot substitute for them.
But we can and should support local and regional ground forces in carrying out this mission. Now, the obstacles to achieving this are significant.
On the Iraqi side of the border, Kurdish forces have fought bravely to defend their own lands and to retake towns from ISIS. But the Iraqi national army has struggled. It is going to take more work to get it up to fighting shape. As part of that process, we may have to give our own troops advising and training the Iraqis greater freedom of movement and flexibility, including embedding in local units and helping target airstrikes.
Ultimately, however, the ground campaign in Iraq will only succeed if more Iraqi Sunnis join the fight. But that will not happen so long as they do not feel they have a stake in their country or confidence in their own security and capacity to confront ISIS.
Now, we have been in a similar place before in Iraq. In the first Sunni Awakening in 2007, we were able to provide sufficient support and assurances to the Sunni tribes to persuade them to join us in rooting out Al-Qaeda. Unfortunately, under Prime Minister Maliki's rule, those tribes were betrayed and forgotten. So the task of bringing Sunnis off the sidelines into this new fight will be considerably more difficult. But nonetheless we need to lay the foundation for a second Sunni Awakening.
We need to put sustained pressure on the government in Baghdad to get its political house in order, move forward with national reconciliation, and finally stand up a National Guard. Baghdad needs to accept—even embrace—arming Sunni and Kurdish forces in the war against ISIS. But if Baghdad will not do that, the coalition should do so, directly.
On the Syrian side, the big obstacle to getting more ground forces to engage ISIS—beyond the Syrian Kurds who are already deep in the fight—is that the viable Sunni opposition groups remain understandably preoccupied with fighting Assad, who let us remember has killed many more Syrians than the terrorists have. But they are increasingly seeing the threat from ISIS as well.
So we need to move simultaneously toward a political solution to the civil war that paves the way for a new government with new leadership, and to encourage more Syrians to take on ISIS as well. To support them, we should immediately deploy the special operations force President Obama has already authorized and be prepared to deploy more, as more Syrians get into the fight. And we should retool and ramp up our efforts to support and equip viable Syrian opposition units.
Our increased support should go hand-in-hand with increased support from our Arab and European partners, including special forces who can contribute to the fight on the ground. We should also work with the coalition and the neighbors to impose no-fly zones that will stop Assad from slaughtering civilians and the opposition from the air. Opposition forces on the ground, with material support from the coalition, could then help create safe areas where Syrians could remain in the country rather than fleeing toward Europe. This combined approach would help enable the opposition to retake the remaining stretch of the Turkish border from ISIS, choking off its supply lines. It would also give us new leverage in the diplomatic process that Secretary Kerry is pursuing.
Of course, we have been down plenty of diplomatic dead-ends before in this conflict. But we have models for how seemingly intractable, multi-sectarian civil wars do eventually end. We can learn lessons from Lebanon and Bosnia about what it will take. And Russia and Iran have to face the fact that continuing to prop up a vicious dictator will not bring stability. Right now, I am afraid President Putin is actually making things somewhat worse.
Now to be clear though, there is a role for Russia to help for resolving the conflict in Syria. And we have indicated a willingness to work with them toward an outcome that preserves Syria as a unitary, non-sectarian state, with protections of the rights of all Syrians and to keep key state institutions intact. There is no alternative to a political transition that allows Syrians to end Assad's rule. Now, much of this strategy on both sides of the border hinges on the roles of our Arab and Turkish partners. And we must get them to carry their share of the burden, with military, intelligence, and financial contributions, as well as using their influence with fighters and tribes in Iraq and Syria.
Countries like Jordan have offered more, and we should take them up on it. Because ultimately, our efforts will only succeed if the Arabs and Turks step up in a much bigger way. This is their fight and they need to act like it. So far, however, Turkey has been more focused on the Kurds than on countering ISIS. And to be fair, Turkey has a long and painful history with Kurdish terrorist groups. But the threat from ISIS cannot wait.
As difficult as it may be, we need to get Turkey to stop bombing Kurdish fighters in Syria who are battling ISIS and become a full partner of our coalition efforts against ISIS. The United States should also work with our Arab partners to get them more invested in the fight against ISIS. At the moment, they are focused in other areas, because of their concerns in the region, especially the threat from Iran. That is why the Saudis, for example, shifted attention from Syria to Yemen. So we have to work out a common approach.
In September, I laid out a comprehensive plan to counter Iranian influence across the region and its support for terrorist proxies such as Hezbollah and Hamas. We cannot view Iran and ISIS as separate challenges. Regional politics are too interwoven. Raising the confidence of our Arab partners and raising the costs to Iran for bad behavior will contribute to a more effective fight against ISIS.
And as we work out a broader regional approach, we should of course be closely consulting with Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East. Israel increasingly shares with our Arab partners and has the opportunity to do more in intelligence and in joint efforts as well.
We should have no illusions about how difficult the mission before us really is. We have to fit a lot of pieces together, bring a lot of partners along, move on multiple fronts at once. But if we press forward on both sides of the border, in the air and on the ground, as well as diplomatically, I do believe we can crush ISIS's enclave of terror.And to support this campaign, Congress should swiftly pass an updated authorization to use military force. That will send a message to friend and foe alike that the United States is committed to this fight. The time for delay is over. We should get this done.
Now, the second element of our strategy looks beyond the immediate battlefield of Iraq and Syria to disrupt and dismantle global terrorist infrastructure on the ground and online. A terror pipeline that facilitates the flow of fighters, financing, arms, and propaganda around the world, has allowed ISIS to strike at the heart of Paris last week, and allowed al-Qaeda affiliate to do the same at Charlie Hebdo earlier this year.
ISIS is working hard to extend its reach, establishing affiliates and cells far from its home base. And despite significant setbacks it has encountered, not just with ISIS and its ambitious plans but even al-Qaeda, including the death of Osama bin Laden. They are still posing rape threats to so many. Let's take one example. We have had a lot of conversation about ISIS in the last week. Let's not forget al-Qaeda. They still have the most sophisticated bomb-makers, ambitious plotters, and active affiliates in places like Yemen and North Africa.
So we can't just focus on Iraq and Syria—we need to intensify our counterterrorism efforts across a wider scope. Most urgent is stopping the flow of foreign fighters to and from the war zones of the Middle East. Thousands, thousands, of young recruits have flocked to Syria from France, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and yes, even the United States. Their Western passports make it easier for them to cross borders and eventually return home, radicalized and battle-hardened.
Stemming this tide will require much better coordination and information sharing among countries every step of the way. We should not stop pressing until Turkey, where most foreign fighters cross into Syria, finally locks down its border. The United States and our allies need to know and share the identities of every fighter who has traveled to Syria.
We also have to be smart and target interventions that will have the greatest impact. For example, we need a greater focus on shutting down key enablers who arrange transportation, documents, and more. When it comes to terrorist financing, we have to go after the nodes that facilitate illicit trade and transactions.
The U.N. Security Council should update its terrorism sanctions. They have a resolution that does try to block terrorist financing and other enabling activities but we have to place more obligation on countries to police their own banks. And the United States, which has quite a record of success in this area, can share more intelligence to help other countries.
And, once and for all, the Saudis, the Qataris, and others need to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations, as well as schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path toward radicalization. When it comes to blocking terrorist recruitment, we have to identify the hotspots—the specific neighborhoods and villages, the prisons and schools—where recruitment happens in clusters. Like the neighborhood in Brussels where the Paris attacks were planned. Through partnerships with local law enforcement and civil society—especially Muslim community leaders—we have to work to tip the balance away from extremism in these hotspots.
Radicalization and recruitment also is happening online. And there is no doubt we have to do a better job contesting online space, including websites and chat rooms where jihadists communicate with followers. We must deny them virtual territory, just as we deny them actual territory.At the State Department, I built up a unit of communications specialists fluent in Urdu, Arabic, Somali, and other languages to do battle with extremists online. We need more of that, including from the private sector.
Social media companies can also do their part by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts so they are not used to plan, provoke, or celebrate violence.Online or offline, the bottom line is that we are in a contest of ideas against an ideology of hate—and we have to win it.
Now, let's be clear though: Islam itself is not our adversary. Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
The obsession in some quarters with a ""clash of civilizations"" or repeating the specific words ""radical Islamic terrorism"" is not just a distraction, it gives these criminals, these murderers, more standing than they deserve and it actually plays into their hands by alienating partners we need by our side. Our priority should be how to fight the enemy. In the end, it didn't matter what kind of terrorist we called Bin Laden, it mattered that we killed Bin Laden.
But we still can't close our eyes to the fact that there is a distorted and dangerous strain of extremism within the Muslim world that continues to spread. Its adherents are relatively few in number, but capable of causing profound damage—most especially to their own communities throughout an arc of instability that stretches from North and West Africa to Asia.
Overlapping conflicts, collapsing state structures, widespread corruption, poverty, and repression have created openings for extremists to exploit. Before the Arab Spring, I warned that the region's foundations would ""sink into the sand"" without immediate reforms. Well, the need has only grown more urgent.
We have to join with our partners to do the patient, steady work of empowering moderates and marginalizing extremists: supporting democratic institutions and the rule of law, creating economic growth that supports stability, working to curb corruption, helping train effective and accountable local intelligence, law enforcement, and counterterrorism services.
As we do this, we must be building up a global counterterrorism infrastructure that is more effective and adaptable than the terror networks we're trying to defeat. When I became secretary of state, I was surprised to find that nearly a decade after 9/11, there was still no dedicated international vehicle to regularly convene key countries to deal with terrorist threats.
So we created the Global Counterterrorism Forum, which now brings together nearly 30 countries, many from the Muslim world. It should be a clearinghouse for directing assistance to countries that need it, for mobilizing common action against threats. And let's not lose sight of the global cooperation needed to lock down loose nuclear material, and chemical and biological weapons—and keep them out of the hands of terrorists.
At the end of the day, we still must be prepared to go after terrorists wherever they plot, using all the tools at our disposal. That includes targeted strikes by U.S. military aircraft and drones, with proper safeguards, when there aren't any other viable options to deal with continuing imminent threats. All of this—stopping foreign fighters, blocking terrorist financing, doing battle in cyberspace—is vital to the war against ISIS, but it is also lays the foundation for defusing and defeating the next threat and the one after that.
Now the third element of our strategy has to be hardening our defenses at home and helping our partners do the same against both external and homegrown threats. After 9/11, the United States made a lot of progress breaking down bureaucratic barriers to allow for more and better information sharing among agencies responsible for keeping us safe.
We still have work to do on this front, but by comparison, Europe is way behind.
Today, European nations do not even always alert each other when they turn away a suspected jihadist at the border or when a passport is stolen. It seems like after most terrorist attacks, we find out that the perpetrators were known to some security service or another, but too often the dots never get connected. I appreciate how hard this is, especially given the sheer number of suspects and threats, but this has to change. The United States must work with Europe to dramatically and immediately improve intelligence sharing and counterterrorism coordination.
European countries also should have the flexibility to enhance their border controls when circumstances warrant. And here at home, we face a number of our own challenges.
The threat to airline security is evolving as terrorists develop new devices like non-metallic bombs, so our defenses have to stay, at least, one step ahead. We know that intelligence gathered and shared by local law enforcement officers is absolutely critical to breaking up plots and preventing attacks. So they need all the resources and support we can give them.
Law enforcement also needs the trust of residents and communities, including in our own country Muslim-Americans. This should go without saying, but in the current climate it bears repeating: Muslim Americans are working every day on the front lines of the fight against radicalization.
Another challenge is how to strike the right balance of protecting privacy and security. Encryption of mobile communications presents a particularly tough problem. We should take the concerns of law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals seriously. They have warned that impenetrable encryption may prevent them from accessing terrorist communications and preventing a future attack.
On the other hand we know there are legitimate concerns about government intrusion, network security, and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors can and would exploit. So we need Silicon Valley not to view government as its adversary. We need to challenge our best minds in the private sector to work with our best minds in the public sector. To develop solutions that will both keep us safe and protect our privacy. Now is the time to solve this problem, not after the next attack.
Since Paris, no homeland security challenge is being more hotly debated than how to handle Syrian refugees seeking safety in the United States.
Our highest priority, of course, must always be protecting the American people.
So yes, we do need to be vigilant in screening and vetting any refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security professionals in close coordination with our allies and partners.
And Congress needs to make sure the necessary resources are provided for comprehensive background checks, drawing on the best intelligence we can get. And we should be taking a close look at the safeguards in visa programs as well. But we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and humanitarian obligations.
Turning away orphans, applying a religious test, discriminating against Muslims, slamming the door on every single Syrian refugee—that is just not who we are. We are better than that.
And remember, many of these refugees are fleeing the same terrorists who threaten us. It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from ever finding new ones. We should be doing more to ease this humanitarian crisis, not less. We should lead the international community in organizing a donor conference and supporting countries like Jordan who are sheltering the majority of refugees fleeing Syria.
And we can get this right. America's open, free, tolerant society is described by some as a vulnerability in the struggle against terrorism. But I actually believe it is one of our greatest strengths. It reduces the appeal of radicalism and enhances the richness and resilience of our communities.
This is not a time for scoring political points. When New York was attacked on 9/11, we had a Republican president, a Republican governor, and a Republican mayor, and I worked with all of them. We pulled together and put partisanship aside to rebuild our city and protect our country. This is a time for American leadership.
No other country can rally the world to defeat ISIS and win the generational struggle against radical jihadism. Only the United States can mobilize common action on a global scale.
And that is exactly what we need. The entire world must be part of this fight, but we must lead it.
There's been a lot of talk lately about coalitions. Everyone seems to want one. But there is not nearly as much talk about what it actually takes to make a coalition work in the heat and pressure of an international crisis.
I know how hard this is because we have done it before: To impose the toughest sanctions in history on Iran. To stop a dictator from slaughtering his people in Libya. To support a fledgling democracy in Afghanistan.
We have to use every pillar of American power—military might but also diplomacy, development aid, economic and cultural influence, technology, and the force of our values. That is smart power.
You have to work with institutions and partners, like NATO, the EU, the Arab League, and the U.N. Strengthen alliances and never get tired of old-fashioned shoe-leather diplomacy.
And, if necessary, be prepared to act decisively on our own, just as we did to bring Osama bin Laden to justice. The United States and our allies must demonstrate that free people and free markets are still the hope of humanity.
This past week, as I watched the tragic scenes from France, I kept thinking back to a young man the world met in January, after the last attack in Paris. His name was Lassana, a Muslim immigrant from Mali who worked at a kosher market. He said the market had become a new home and his colleagues and customers, a ""second family.""
When the terrorist arrived and the gunfire began, Lassana risked his life to protect his Jewish customers. He moved quickly, hiding as many people as he could in the cold storage room and then slipping out to help the police.
""I didn't know or care,"" he said, ""if they were Jews or Christians or Muslims. We are all in the same boat.""What a rebuke to the extremists' hatred.
The French government announced it would grant Lassana full citizenship. But when it mattered most, he proved he was a citizen already.
That is the power of free people. That is what the jihadis will never understand and never defeat.
And as we meet here today, let us resolve that we will go forward together and we will do all we can to lead the world against this threat, that threatens people everywhere. Thank you all.

Thanksgiving dinner inevitably comes with a side of uncomfortable political conversation. Christina Reynolds, Hillary's deputy director of communications, is here to help with some answers to your FAQs (Family's Awkward Questions):
As Hillary herself has noted on a number of occasions, while the color may not be real, the hair is.
The real question is, what hasn't she done? She was a leader in the Senate and the Obama administration, for starters. As a senator from New York, she helped secure $20 billion in federal aid to rebuild after 9/11 and to care for responders. She helped create the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which covers more than 8 million kids and cut the children's uninsured rate in half. She negotiated a 2012 ceasefire between Israel and Hamas as secretary of state.
As Marco Rubio put it, ""if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton is going to be the next president.""
Need more material? Check here. (And here. And here.)
Really? So you don't think America is ready for a president with four decades of experience fighting for families and children? That's a shame.
To steal a line from Hillary, the rest of the Republican field is just Trump without the pizzazz or the hair. They've proposed massive tax cuts for the top 1 percent and they're bending over backward to say extreme things that appeal to the rightest end of the right wing. Frankly, there's not much daylight between the Republican candidates at all.
Then get ready for a long campaign. Hillary believes—just like millions of Americans do—that women should have the right to make their own health care decisions. And Planned Parenthood is a vital provider of women's health care.
Equal pay, paid leave, and child care are not ""women's issues""—they're economic issues. Beyond the fact that it's just not right that women make 78 cents on average for every dollar that men make (and that women of color lose out even more), Hillary wants to close the gender wage gap because when women make less than men, their families (and our economy) pay a price.
You're joking, right??Since you asked, at least a dozen U.S. presidents were also grandparents.?
Now get yourself a second helping of yams and stop asking silly questions.

Here Are 5 Times Ted Cruz Tried To Restrict Access To Contraception,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116701,Hillary Clinton,"Jiminy Cricket!
Ted Cruz says he has ""never met anybody—any conservative—who wants to ban contraceptives.""
Hey, Ted? Let us introduce you to one conservative trying to limit access to contraception. His name is Ted Cruz.
Here are five times—and counting—Cruz has personally tried to make it harder for women to get birth control:
1. The time he supported a so-called personhood amendment, which could criminalize abortion and could ban some forms of birth control.
He scored this endorsement for his efforts:
2. The time he was willing to shut down the government to cut funding from Planned Parenthood.
3. The time he called for the Supreme Court to turn women's personal health decisions over to their employers by striking down the Obamacare birth control co-pay provision.
Under the Affordable Care Act, millions of women are now getting birth control without a co-pay. Ted Cruz not only wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act—he celebrated the Hobby Lobby ruling that allowed CEOs of for-profit corporations to decide whether or not to cover birth control for their employees.
4. The time he tried to get rid of a law that made it so women couldn't be fired for their personal reproductive decisions (including birth control).
Or having an abortion.
5. And the time he used a medically and scientifically incorrect argument to try to ban emergency contraception.
Ted Cruz wants to be president (and he's got as much of a shot as any of the Republican candidates). But he not only refuses to face the truth that women's health and rights are under attack in this country -- he has a long record of trying to limit access to birth control (and ban abortion, and cut women off from preventive care). That's what's at stake in 2016.

That's like someone being like, ?I don't really believe in cars, but I drive one every day and I love that it gets me places and makes life so much easier and faster and I don't know what I would do without it.'""
"" The term feminist is so inclusive now. There isn't one way to be a feminist or to practice feminism, to exercise feminism. You can be feminist in lots of different ways because the point is freedom of choice.""
"" I am a feminist. When I stop and think about it, there's no other way I can label myself. I am for women.""
"" All men should be feminists. If men care about women's rights, the world will be a better place.""
"" I've always considered myself a feminist, although I was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it when honestly, it's very simple. It's just a person that believes in equality for men and women.""
"" I'm a feminist because I believe in women... it's a heavy word, feminism, but it's not one I think we should run from. I'm proud to be a feminist.""
And, of course, Hillary Clinton.?

As Secretary of State, Hillary went to speak in Geneva for International Human Rights Day.
She made a simple—but important—statement.
With those words, Hillary sent a powerful message around the globe.
During her travels, Hillary had spoken with activists and advocates who told her about human rights abuses LGBT people still endured around the world. In some countries, those abuses were even written into laws and constitutions.
At the time of Hillary's speech, the government of Malawi maintained a nationwide ban on homosexuality. It was against the law to be gay.
A few days later, Malawi placed their ban under review.?Hillary's speech started a conversation about LGBT rights in a country where being gay was illegal.?Countries around the world paid attention—some for the first time—to this important human rights issue.
Four years later, the lives of many LGBT people around the world have improved—but the fight for full equality is far from over, including here at home.
"" Our work isn't finished until every single person is treated with equal rights and dignity that they deserve—no matter how old they are, no matter where they live, whether it's New York or Wyoming or anywhere else.""Hillary at the Human Rights Campaign Breakfast, October 3, 2015
Despite the historic win for marriage equality, there are still places in America where LGBT people can be married on Sunday and fired on Monday. More than 22 transgender women, primarily women of color, have been murdered in America this year—and that doesn't include the violence that goes unreported or ignored. LGBT people in can still be legally discriminated against in employment, housing, public education, public accommodations, access to federal funding and credit, and the jury system.
Hillary knows that the fight for equality will not be finished until every American can not only marry, but live, work, pray, learn and raise a family free from discrimination. She is committed to working with LGBT Americans to stand up for their fundamental rights—and is ready for the fight ahead.

At a speech today on the alliance between the United States and Israel, Hillary reiterated her plan to combat terrorism and defeat the Islamic State.
She addressed the mass shooting in San Bernardino.
""Our intelligence and law enforcement agencies will continue learning about what led to the massacre in San Bernardino, just as French and Belgian authorities are doing so in Paris and Brussels. But this much we do know: the threat from radical jihadism has metastasized and become more complex and challenging. We're seeing the results of radicalization not just in far-off lands, but right here at home.""
And she reminded us of something important.?
""I think it's important to remind ourselves that Islam itself is not our adversary. This is not, and we should not let it become, a 'clash of civilizations.' It is a clash between hate and hope. And the vast majority of Muslims are on our side of the battle. We can't buy into the very narrative that radical jihadists use to recruit new followers or alienate partners we want and need at home and abroad with reckless rhetoric. Declaring war on Islam or demonizing the Muslim-American community is not only counter to our values—it plays right into the hands of terrorists.""
And she laid out a three-pronged plan to destroy ISIS and defeat global terror.
""First: Deny ISIS territory in Iraq and Syria by leading an intensified air campaign and working with local and regional forces on the ground.?Second: Dismantle the global infrastructure of terror, the networks that supply radical jihadists with money, weapons, and fighters, and stop them recruiting and inspiring.?And third: Toughen our defenses at home—and those of our partners—against external and homegrown threats.""

Unlike men's teams, women's professional soccer teams play on artificial turf instead of real grass.
And in this case, the issue went even deeper than the playing surface. This wasn't about the type of surface they were playing on—it was about the unsafe conditions on the field where they were expected to play their match. (You can read more here.)
Unfortunately, this second-class treatment isn't new.
This year, the U.S. women's team was awarded $2 million for winning the World Cup—just a quarter of what the men's team earned for making it to the first round.
Professional soccer isn't the only field where women aren't treated equally.
Women are still earning less than men in nearly every industry, despite the fact that a majority of families with children are being supported by women's salaries.
"" When women are held back, our country is held back. When women get ahead, everyone gets ahead.""Hillary Clinton, April 23, 2015
Women working full-time jobs aren't doing 22 percent less work than their male counterparts. So why are they being paid 78 percent as much—with women of color often losing out even more?

Republicans in Congress have actually allowed the bill to expire.
If Congress doesn't act quickly, many responders with cancer and respiratory diseases are going to lose their medical care.

We're Not Barring Muslims From Entering the Country",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116978,Hillary Clinton,"And a message to Muslims.
Donald Trump has made a name for himself in this election by trafficking in prejudice and paranoia. Now he says he wants to stop all Muslims from entering the United States. It's a shameful idea. It's also dangerous. At a time when America should be doing everything we can to fight radical jihadists, Mr. Trump is supplying them with new propaganda. He's playing right into their hands.
Now some Republican candidates are saying that Donald Trump's latest comments have gone too far. But the truth is, many GOP candidates have also said extreme things about Muslims. Their language may be more veiled than Mr. Trump's, but their ideas aren't so different.
Ben Carson says that a Muslim shouldn't be president. Marco Rubio compares Muslims to members of the Nazi Party and refuses to rule out monitoring and closing of mosques. Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz have suggested that we implement a religious test for Syrian refugees—one that only Christians would pass. Chris Christie says not even 3-year-old Syrian orphans should be let in. And they insist on using the phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism""—in fact, they criticize anyone who says anything else—even though it drives the exact narrative the jihadists want to advance: that we're at war with an entire religion.
When you take a step back and see what the Republican field as a whole says about Muslims—not just one or two candidates for President, but nearly all of them—it's hard to take seriously their attempts to distance themselves from Mr. Trump. He's just articulating the logical conclusion of what the rest of them have been saying. As Mr. Trump said in an interview this morning, ""They condemn practically everything I say, and then they come to my side.""
That should concern all of us. This kind of rhetoric sets us back in the fight against radical jihadists—a fight we absolutely have to win, against a brutal, nihilistic enemy who twists Islam to justify mass murder. These jihadists cannot be contained; they have to be defeated. And the vast majority of Muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight. Many are helping prevent radicalization, including here at home. So why would anyone suggest that they're the enemy? How does that help us? Radical jihadists are telling people that the United States hates Muslims—and there's Donald Trump on TV screaming about how he's going to keep all Muslims out. He's strengthening the terrorists' argument.
He's also taking aim at our values. Our country was founded by people fleeing religious persecution. The notion that here, people are free to practice their faith, whatever it is, is one of America's most cherished principles. Maybe Mr. Trump should re-read President Washington's 1790 letter to the Jewish community of Newport, Rhode Island, reassuring them that, in the brand-new nation of the United States, their religious liberty would always be protected. He wrote, ""The Government of the United States gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance."" In other words, you can be you, and still be with us.
That's something I'll bet a lot of Muslim Americans need to hear right now. Imagine hearing political leaders threaten to register and track you, implying that your religion is violent, that you're violent, that you're the enemy. Nearly 3 million Americans are Muslims. They're our family, our friends, our neighbors, and co-workers. They serve in the military, save lives as doctors and nurses, and serve our communities as police officers, firefighters, teachers, and civic leaders. They're patriots—proud Americans, just like the rest of us. They deserve better than this.
So today, I want to send a different message.
To Muslim Americans: What you're hearing from Trump and other Republicans is absolutely, unequivocally wrong. It's inconsistent with our values as a nation—a nation which you are helping to build. This is your country, too. I'm proud to be your fellow American. And many, many other Americans feel the same way.
Now is the time for all of us—especially Republican leaders—to stand up to hateful, dangerous words and deeds.
Just a few days ago, two young women wearing headscarves were trying to have breakfast at a cafй near the University of Texas at Austin when another diner started shouting racist things at them. The girls left in tears—in part because of the ugly words, but also because no one else in that crowded cafй came to their defense.
As they left, one of the girls asked the room, ""Who cares about us?"" Somebody called out, ""Nobody."" ""We left,"" they said, ""because it was true.""
But it's not true. And we have to make sure Muslim Americans know that. It's how we stay true to our values as Americans. And it's how we show the world who we really are—a strong, proud, united country that still knows, after all these years, that all men and women are created equal.

Hillary Clinton Has a Plan To Stop Them,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116908,Hillary Clinton,"Corporations don't need another tax break.
Powerful corporations try to game the tax system to pay as little as possible. And for far too long, American taxpayers have had to pick up the slack.
Here's just one example: The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer found a clever way to lower their tax bill.
In a $160 billion deal, Pfizer is merging with Allergen to form the world's largest drug company—and they're moving their on-paper residence overseas to escape paying their fair share in U.S. taxes.
They'll get legal protections and the support of U.S. taxpayers for operating here:?
But on paper, they'll be based (and pay far lower taxes) here:
Corporations like Pfizer use so-called ""inversions"" to shortchange taxpayers by billions of dollars every year. And these loopholes put American workers and small businesses at a major disadvantage.
Hillary will crack down on companies that shift profits overseas to avoid paying their fair share in U.S. taxes.
Hillary's plan will end the loopholes that reward companies for moving overseas and shift earnings abroad—and use the proceeds to reward the ones that invest here in the United States. It would charge a new ""exit tax"" for companies leaving the U.S. to settle up on their untaxed foreign earnings. And it will provide more support to American businesses—especially smaller manufacturers—so that they can compete.
That means more jobs and corporate tax dollars at home.

Here's How To Stop It From Happening Again",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116911,Hillary Clinton,"Hillary's plan to take on prescription price gouging would have prevented it.
Imagine the life-saving pill you've been relying on for years costs $13.50 per tablet. Then one morning, you wake up and that same pill suddenly costs $750 per tablet.
Sound like a nightmare? It actually happened.
A company called Turing purchased a 62-year-old drug used most frequently as therapy for HIV patients. Then they ratcheted the price up by more than 5,550 percent overnight—just to turn a profit.
What Turing did was perfectly legal under our current laws. It's a particularly egregious example of a wider problem: Pharmaceutical companies are earning between $80 and $90 billion in profits by charging middle-class families thousands of dollars for their prescriptions, often at significantly higher prices in the U.S.
Prescription drugs should be affordable for all Americans.
We've got to fight to make sure that American families and seniors aren't being robbed by an industry that focuses on profits, not patients. We won't be able to stop every actor like Martin Shkreli, but there's a lot we can do to make the pharmaceutical industry fairer for every American?—and Hillary's already getting started.
Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I'll lay out a plan to take it on. -H https://t.co/9Z0Aw7aI6h— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 21, 2015
After Hillary called out Martin Shkreli, he announced he would reduce the price ... by 10%.?
A 10% price reduction is insulting. As I've said before, the FDA and FTC need to step in to protect consumers. https://t.co/guopHDGOBz -H— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 5, 2015
Here are four ways we can stop companies from price-gouging patients in the future.
1. Require drug companies to spend a minimum on research and development, not profits and marketing.?A provision of the Affordable Care Act limits how much your insurance company could spend on overhead, including administrative costs, profits, and advertising. Hillary's plan would apply a version of this rule to drug companies. Turing and other companies would have to spend a minimum on research and development, lowering their incentive to chase ever-higher earnings through price gouging, and making more funds available for research that could lead to the development of competitor drugs.
2. Require drug companies to justify price increases.?Like Turing, many biotech companies operate on a deliberate strategy of purchasing old drugs, driving up the price, and calling them ""specialty drugs."" Hillary's plan invests in private organizations that serve as a second opinion for consumers and payers. By making clearer what a drug actually costs to produce, insurance companies?—?and under Hillary's plan, Medicare?—can negotiate lower rates, while giving consumers a sense of what is a ridiculous asking price and what isn't.
3. Encourage more competition.?When drugs are the only ones of their kind on the market, drug companies often charge excessive prices. Sound familiar? With more drugs on the market, companies like Turing wouldn't be able to inflate prices without concern for competition.
4. Require health insurance plans to place a monthly limit of $250 on covered out-of-pocket prescription drug costs.?This would lift a huge burden for patients with chronic or serious health conditions, and would ensure Americans can get the care their doctors prescribe. Up to a million Americans could benefit from this proposal every year.

For the first time in more than four decades, the majority of Americans are no longer considered middle class.
Thanks to President Obama's leadership, we've come back from the Great Recession, but middle- and lower-income Americans still aren't seeing their paychecks grow—and they're falling further and further behind the wealthy. ?
Hillary believes our economy depends on a strong middle class—and that means we have to raise incomes for hardworking Americans.
Here are 7 ways we can give Americans a raise.
1. Raise the minimum wage. Too many hardworking Americans are raising families in poverty or living under the stress of mounting bills. Hillary wants to change that. That's why she'll fight to raise the federal minimum wage and create more good-paying jobs.
2. Cut middle-class taxes. Hillary is proposing middle-class tax breaks to help families cope with the rising cost of everyday expenses like groceries and child care. She also announced new tax credits to help families caring for an ill or aging family member. She'll pay for them by raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans and closing loopholes in our tax code. ?
3. Make college affordable. We can lift American incomes by making quality education attainable for everyone. Under Hillary's ""New College Compact,""?students won't have to take out loans for tuition or books at in-state public colleges and universities, and Americans with student loan debt will be able to refinance at a lower rate.
4. Support unions. Hillary believes that unions are the backbone of our economy—and key to a strong middle class. That's why she is fighting to protect collective bargaining rights and strengthen America's labor movement.
5. Rebuild our infrastructure. Hillary's $275 billion plan?will not only repair America's roads and bridges, build world-class airports, and expand internet access—it will also create good-paying, middle-class jobs in the construction, building, and transportation industries.
6. Boost manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing is a vital source of good-paying jobs in our economy. Hillary's plan will spur reinvestment in communities that have lost manufacturing jobs and give more support to small manufacturers and startups.
7.?Invest in clean energy. Renewable energy one of America's fastest growing industries. Hillary launched two bold national goals to make the United States the world's clean energy superpower and create new jobs sectors like wind and solar.

Hillary has never backed down from a tough fight—even when that fight is with some of the worst human rights offenders in the world. Here are three important times Hillary wasn't afraid to speak out on behalf of fundamental rights and human dignity around the world.
1. When she stood up for women around the world:
You might be familiar with this rallying cry—Hillary's words, coming from the first lady of the United States, were heard around the world. But what made her speech so bold was the fact that she called out gender violence and human rights abuses by name, because she believed you don't shy away from confronting these issues head on.
2. When she declared LGBT rights are human rights:
As secretary of state, Hillary brought LGBT rights to the forefront of U.S. foreign policy. When she declared to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that gay rights are human rights, her words were called ""the strongest defense ever in terms of gay rights"" at the time.
3. When she brought attention to human rights violations in Cuba—and applauded those working to stop them:
As a candidate for president, Hillary took an unprecedented position: calling for the end to the U.S. embargo of Cuba. And she named the human rights abuses that the Cuban government has perpetrated on its own citizens, including the courageous Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White), the wives of Cuban dissidents who have stood up to the regime for more than 10 years.

On September 13, 2001, Alex Sanchez showed up for work at Ground Zero.?
Just two days earlier, he had watched two airplanes crash into the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan. ""I didn't know whether to go left or right,"" he says. ""That's how I define terror—when you don't even know whether to go left or right.""
Alex was among the thousands of workers who worked around the clock to clean up Ground Zero. Working to clean up the ventilation system in a neighboring skyscraper, he was in a confined space and exposed to the an overwhelming amount of what he calls ""World Trade dust.""?
He considered it an honor to help his country and his nation, and he spent six months at Ground Zero, working 12 to 14-hour shifts. But months later, Alex started feeling sick.
Eventually he couldn't go back to work.?
A few years later, he saw a public service announcement asking Ground Zero clean-up crews to go to Mount Sinai Hospital for tests. When he showed up, he recognized fellow workers—and he knew deep down what had made him sick.?
Like many of his fellow responders, Alex was never given the necessary training or the proper gear to protect them from exposure to toxins. And—to add insult to injury—politicians in Washington were complicating efforts to ensure 9/11 responders had access to the medical care and aid they needed.?
He remembers one senator was different.?
""I had the opportunity to meet [Hillary] in the Senate, and she thanked us for our service,"" Alex says. Hillary sponsored the first version of the Zadroga Act, which provides health care for workers like Alex who breathed in toxic fumes at Ground Zero. And she has fought tirelessly to make sure that 9/11 responders could have the medical care they deserve.
Hillary at Ground Zero.
But that law has expired—even though it has enough votes in both the House and the Senate.
It's being blocked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who refuses to bring a bill permanently renewing the Zadroga Act to the floor for a vote.?
For Alex, the stakes could not be more personal. Many of his co-workers and fellow advocates have serious illness—and some have died.?
The fact that these courageous men and women are still waiting for Republicans in Washington to permanently recognize their sacrifice is unjustifiable. ?
Hillary agrees.?
Tell @SenateMajLdr to bring a vote on the #ZadrogaAct for 9/11 responders. Their sacrifice deserves our commitment to their health. -H— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) December 10, 2015
It's time for politicians to repay the sacrifice Alex and his fellow workers made in the aftermath of September 11. It's time for Republicans to stop playing politics with their health and well-being. It's time to make the Zadroga Act permanent.?

I Just Wanted To Marry the Man That I Loved,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116778,Hillary Clinton,"How I took my fight all the way to the Supreme Court and became an advocate for LGBT rights.
Recently, I realized something people say all the time is actually true.
One person—or a group—standing up for what's right actually can change the world. Even if that wasn't the original plan.
A few years ago, my partner and I wanted to get married. He was sick, and we wanted to make sure the last record of our relationship wasn't a lie.
Little did we know, this would take us all the way to the Supreme Court. We never expected to win—but we did.
The third time John and I saw each other, we fell in love.
We built our life together in Cincinnati, Ohio. Over the years, we talked about marriage, but we wanted to wait until it actually carried legal weight.
Then, in 2011, almost 20 years into our relationship, John was diagnosed with ALS.
By 2013, he was bedridden, and in at-home hospice care. I was his full time caregiver.
On June 26 of that year, when the Supreme Court ruled that part of the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional, I proposed. It was our first opportunity to get married, and have our government acknowledge us.
I was losing the love of my life, just as the country began moving towards equality.
We couldn't get married at home in Cincinnati due to Ohio's constitutional amendment, so I had to figure out where we could go. We chose Maryland, because that state didn't require both people appear in person to apply for a marriage license.
After I got the license, we flew back together on a chartered medical jet. We landed at Baltimore Washington International Airport, parked on the tarmac, and got married right there, on July 11, 2013.
Then we flew home.
But even though the country had changed, Ohio hadn't.
A few days later, we met a civil rights attorney who shared some bad news:
""I'm sure you don't realize this, but when John dies, his last official record as a person will be incorrect,"" he said. ""Ohio will say he's single—and Jim, your name won't be there as his surviving spouse.""
It broke our hearts. It made us angry. We filed suit against the state of Ohio that Friday.
Three days later, a judge issued a temporary order that forced Ohio to complete John's death certificate accurately when he died. We won.
Three months later, John was gone.
The following July, the judge made that temporary order permanent—then, the State of Ohio appealed.
And ... you know how that ended up.
Even though marriage equality is now legal nationwide, I'm still fighting.
When we sued, I wasn't thinking about the future—at that point, the future meant John's death.
But Ohio's refusal to acknowledge us ended up giving me a level of recognition I never wanted to have—and I wouldn't trade it for anything. I get to keep telling our love story and talking about an incredible moment in our country's history. I get to keep fighting for us.
Too many people think that the fight for LGBT rights ended with marriage equality—but that's not true.
Some Americans believe discriminating against an LGBT person is illegal. It isn't.
Across this country, people can still be fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Our transgender brothers and sisters are being murdered, simply for trying to live their lives. Trans women of color are being killed at an alarmingly high rate. As many as 40 percent of homeless youth are LGBT, and a large portion of them, I'm certain, are homeless because of the discrimination that they face.
That's why I endorsed Hillary Clinton. Not only does she understand how important the continued fight for equality is, but she has the experience, the knowledge, and the drive to get things done—and to make life safer and more equal for LGBT Americans.
I did what I did for love.
I fight for John, and for all the people who want to be able to love freely and openly, to love themselves, without fear.
John lives on in me. And he lives on through this fight."

In a political season where some are trying to reject another set of refugees fleeing an unimaginable civil war, the Dayton Accords hold powerful lessons for Americans.
Twenty years ago today, Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian leaders ended a three-and-a-half year war that claimed more than a hundred thousand lives by signing the Dayton Accords. Thousands of Bosnian refugees flocked to America in the 1990s, fleeing genocidal violence against Muslims in the Balkans.
One of the cities that Bosnian citizens immigrated to is my hometown of St. Louis. Last Friday, I had the chance to travel with Hillary back to the city, where she and I met with community leaders. As this anniversary drew close, our conversations with local Bosnian leaders have held special meaning.
In July, Bosnian Americans commemorated the 20-year anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, when more than 8,000 men and boys were brutally murdered in Europe's worst atrocity since World War II. This incident sparked global outrage.
For Bosnian Americans in places like St. Louis, Jacksonville, Des Moines, Chicago, and Waterloo, this has been a year of quiet remembrance, mourning, and sometimes celebration.
Last month, President Clinton returned to Dayton, Ohio, where members of his administration worked night and day in 1995 to push Balkan leaders—sequestered away from the world media at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base—to broker a peace agreement that would end the slaughter of thousands of innocent people.
The Bosnian Americans, who came to this country 20 years ago seeking solace and have made amazing contributions to our community, serve as a powerful reminder of the strength we draw from openness and diversity. For example, my former neighbors in St. Louis have helped revitalize the Bevo Mill neighborhood south of downtown, starting thriving businesses, and enriching the life of my city in countless ways.
Because the civil war in Syria and subsequent refugee crisis has painful echos for many Bosnian Americans, many in the community have become strong advocates for the next generation of refugees, who are just as eager to come to America as this community was two decades ago. We should all follow their example.?
I am proud to work for Secretary Clinton, who agrees we should greet some of the most vulnerable men, women and children in the world with open arms and open hearts.

Republican candidates talk a big game about fighting terrorism—but bluster isn't enough. Hillary has a detailed plan to keep America safe.
1. Shut down ISIS recruitment in the United States, especially online.
Washington and Silicon Valley need to work together to defeat jihadists in cyberspace. That means identifying and removing the extremist content that terrorists use to recruit online.
2. Stop would-be jihadists from getting training overseas, and stop foreign terrorists from coming here.
We need to know the identity of jihadists and stop them before they cross our border. The United States and its allies need to vigilantly screen visa applicants, share information, and alert each other to potential threats.
3. Discover and disrupt plots before they are carried out.
Better intelligence is key to intercepting terror plots—but we also have to stop terrorists from carrying them out. That means restoring the assault weapons ban and closing the loopholes that let suspected terrorists buy guns.
4.?Support law enforcement officers who risk their lives to prevent and respond to attacks.
We need to make sure our law enforcement officials have the training and resources they need to keep us safe from terrorism. And we can never turn our backs on the heroes who risk their health and their lives for our country.
5. Empower Muslim American communities on the front lines of the fight against radicalization.
Demonizing Muslims doesn't just go against everything we stand for as Americans—it also threatens our national security. We need to stand up to disgraceful anti-Muslim rhetoric and build trust so that our communities can work hand in hand with law enforcement to stop terrorism.

Listen to the Republican presidential candidates talk about ISIS or how they'll deal with Vladimir Putin, and one thing becomes terrifyingly clear: None of these candidates are ready to be commander-in-chief. Need specifics? Here are eight.
Ted Cruz
Destroying the Islamic State and winning the broader fight against radical jihadism demands a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy. But when pressed for how he'd approach ISIS, Cruz's answer is short on details: ""We win, and they lose.""
Donald Trump
""We got the highest rating in a long time on ?60 Minutes,'"" Trump said. ""You saw that, right? He was my stablemate. I believe I'll get along with him. It was Trump and Putin, Putin and Trump.""
Marco Rubio
When you're resorting to offensive analogies to explain your foreign policy positions, you might be in over your head. Avoiding the phrase radical Islam, Rubio said, ""would be like saying we weren't at war with the Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren't violent themselves.""
Jeb Bush
Asked whether he thought the Iraq war was a mistake—given what we know now that Saddam Hussein did not possess weapons of mass destruction—Jeb Bush was unable to give a straight answer. He offered four different answers over the course of four days.
Chris Christie
Chris Christie is so against giving refugees a home in the United States, he says we shouldn't open our doors to five-year-old orphans fleeing civil war and the threat of ISIS in Syria.
Rand Paul
Rand Paul introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate to stop allowing refugees to enter from Syria and as many as 30 other countries.
Ben Carson
The claim that China is on the ground in Syria has been widely debunked—including by the White House and China. But Ben Carson, who appears to be getting his news about the Syrian Civil War from unconfirmed blog posts and a solitary news report by a Lebanese website, is saying it anyway.
And not a single one of these candidates would support legislation to prevent suspected terrorists from legally purchasing guns in the United States.
Senators Cruz, Rubio, and Paul actually cast votes against giving the attorney general the authority to prevent, on a case-by-case basis, suspected terrorists from purchasing guns when a bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate.
We need a commander-in-chief with the experience to keep America safe—but you won't find that candidate in the Republican field.

Lately, Ted Cruz has been talking a lot about how ""The Princess Bride""?is his favorite movie—he even quotes his favorite lines and does impressions on the campaign trail. We know what you're thinking:
You're not! This is a real thing that's happening. And during Tuesday night's undercard Republican debate, Lindsey Graham invoked Princess Buttercup in his arguments against Cruz.
That's how we felt, too—especially since ""The Princess Bride"" has a lot of great messages about honor, ""mawwaige,"" and not devoting your life to revenge.
But then we got to thinking: Maybe the Republicans DO take some of their policies from wacky misinterpretations of ""The Princess Bride."" Like their take on tax cuts for the rich:
Their obsession with building walls and moats and bureaucracy to keep people out of America:
Their refusal to support equal rights for LGBT people:
Their insistence on calling themselves ""pro-life"" while refusing to take action to prevent gun violence:
And their general commitment to making life even easier for those at the top while offering no real solutions on health care access, college affordability, or raising incomes for the middle class:
But here's the good news: We don't have to let a single one of them become president!
Here's what you can do to stop them: Help elect a president who'll fight harder than the Dread Pirate Roberts to make sure all Americans have a chance to get ahead, no matter what they look like, where they come from, or who they love. So ... what do you think?

While the Republican Party continues to demonize millions of hardworking immigrants, Hillary Clinton spoke passionately about inmigraci?n to the National Immigrant Integration Conference.
She proudly highlighted our nation's immigrant heritage, and laid out her commitment to pass comprehensive immigration reform for those who come in search of a better life for themselves and their families. And she didn't mince words when calling out offensive Republican rhetoric.?
Here are the key takeaways from Hillary's speech. ?
Hillary talked about how the immigrant story is America's story.?
"" We are a country where people of all backgrounds, all nations of origin, all languages, all religions, all races, can make a home. America was built by immigrants.""Hillary Clinton
She promised to pass comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full and equal citizenship—and has a plan if Congress fails to act.?
Unlike the Republicans, Hillary will defend DACA and DAPA, President Obama's executive actions that protect law-abiding immigrants from deportation, and she'll go a step further and put in place a system for the parents of DREAMers and others to be considered for deferred action as well.?
As president she will make sure we show compasi?n to those seeking refuge ...?
"" I'll work to ensure that every single refugee who seeks asylum in the United States has a fair chance to tell his or her story. This is the least we can offer people fleeing persecution and devastation.""Hillary Clinton
... and take steps to help immigrants navigate the citizenship process.
Applying for citizenship can be a lengthy process that often involves significant fees and Hillary's plan provides for more fee-waivers to alleviate some of the burden. She will also increase access to language and outreach programs so more eligible immigrants can get through the naturalization process.?
She pledged to close private detention centers and end family detention.
There are alternatives to detention for those who pose no flight or public safety risk, such as supervised release, that have proved effective and cost a fraction of what it takes to keep families in detention. Hillary will also end private immigrant detention centers.?
She reminded us that this is an economic ?issue ...
Comprehensive immigration reform could ""add hundreds of billions of dollars to our GDP.""
... but stressed that it's not just an economic issue.?
She closed with a few words for the Republican frontrunner.?
"" [W]e all owe a debt of gratitude to the millions of immigrants who have helped to make America the greatest country in the world. You see I disagree with those who say, 'Make America great.' We are great, and we're going to stay great, and we're going to get greater.""Hillary Clinton"

Jackie Ryan was in high school when she first got involved in politics.
During a school board discussion in her small town of Sturbridge, Massachusetts, Jackie heard one of her representatives call transgender students—like her—a threat to their peers.
""I immediately sent him an email,"" she says, ""and told him that what he was saying was completely untrue.""
When the representative ignored Jackie's email, she decided to run for a seat on the school board.
""I think I originally got into it because I wanted to show him why my voice needed to be heard, but very quickly I realized that my campaign was about more than him—or me. It was about the Tantasqua school district.""
Jackie won her campaign, beating out a five-year incumbent for her seat.
Now two years into her term, the 20-year-old representative for the Tantasqua School Committee is the youngest elected official in her district and the first openly transgender elected official in Massachusetts.
And last month, she added another ""first"" to her long list of accolades, as the first elected official in her region to endorse a presidential candidate in the upcoming primary election.
""I endorsed Hillary Clinton, because her experience and her vision for the country speak to me,"" Jackie says. ""She's done so much for so many people: whether it's her work for the Children's Defense Fund, securing benefits for those affected by 9/11, or promoting human rights as secretary of state, she's always fighting. America needs a fighter.""
Jackie believes that the fight for transgender rights will be America's next big equality battle.
""Some states, including Massachusetts, have protection against discrimination when it comes to the LGB community, but when it comes to the T, we are forgotten. But that's going to change,"" she says. ""That's also why I endorsed Hillary. I know that she'll make sure we are protected under the law, and no one else will fight for us as hard as she will.""

And her plan to make college affordable hit home for a lot of people.
Others are grateful for the work she's doing to prevent gun violence.
A few shared their deeply personal connections to her plan to change the way we treat addiction.

Here's What It's Like,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116705,Hillary Clinton,"No two days are ever the same—but all of them are jam-packed.
As a campaign video producer, I've been filming Hillary all over the country for more than three months.?In that time I've learned two things:
1) Any place with a door can double as an office; and
2) Just when exhaustion starts to set in, you'll inevitably meet someone whose story will reenergize you.
Hillary talks to hundreds of new people each day at rallies, along rope lines, in coffee shops, and in town halls. And it's remarkable to watch her listen, take in what they have to say, and think about what she can do to improve their lives.
Here's a glimpse into a typical day on the road with Hillary—though there's really no such thing as ""typical"" when you're running for president.?
Wednesday, December 16th.
8:00 am Wake up in Omaha, NE. (Although it's a solid minute or two before I remember what city we're in and what day it was.)
8:25 am Brief lesson in ironing from Barbara Kinney, campaign photographer and my roommate on the road.
9:00 am Wrangle my gear together. Somehow, grabbing fully charged batteries has a recharging effect on me, too.
9:21 am The traveling team departs the hotel for the day—but not before Hillary's had a chance to chat with the wonderful Hilton staff!
9:24 am Hillary calls into a morning radio show from the ""Scooby Van."" (Like I said, anything with a door can double as an office.) This is already her second interview of the day.
9:40 am Before kicking into high gear for the day, Hillary needs her iced tea fix. No ice to be found—so room temperature tea it is! ?
9:58 am Hillary is getting ready to give remarks on the economy. She's joined by a longtime friend who knows a thing or two about the subject.
10:57 am I hitch a ride with Warren and Susie Buffett to the next event. They tell me how excited they are to be campaigning for Hillary today—and can't imagine how she keeps up with such a demanding schedule. As we pull into the venue, Susie tells me to get ready for a ""funky little place."" Bring on the funk!
11:10 am?More than 900 people pack the old gymnastics gym in Omaha, NE for Hillary's remarks. Nebraska is excited to see Hillary. At one point, she says ""I need your help!"" and someone in the crowd yells back ""You got it!"" I always knew I liked the Midwest.
12:00 pm?After the speech, Hillary greets a fired-up line of supporters, including a high school student who hands her something special—a book of poetry he wrote about the neglect and abandonment he faced as a child. She is honored to take the book and promises to read it.
12:54 pm Arrive at the airport. Next stop: Iowa City.
2:00 pm Arrive in Iowa City. Our first order of business is a special surprise for Iowa State Director Matt Paul! We tell him Hillary wants to have a ""serious chat."" But it's actually just a decoy for a birthday celebration, complete with what Hillary calls ""a good old fashioned sheet cake."" (As you can see, Matt promptly takes a bite out of it.)
4:09 pm We depart the Iowa City town hall—and on the way out encounter a group of University of Iowa students with a life-size cutout of Hillary. Photos ensue.
5:24 pm Arrive in Mason City for a TV interview. Hillary points out that the taping room would be a great place to throw a party. I don't disagree.
6:01 pm?Hillary meets three new Iowa caucus volunteer leaders who will accompany her on stage. She is VERY excited to have their help!
6:58 pm Final question of the day comes from a young woman in the crowd: ""After 8 years of a Clinton presidency, what is your vision for America in 2024?"" You know what they say... save the best for last.
All in all, it was a great day to be out on the trail. We got to hear from so many people—of every age and from all walks of life—about what's on their minds and what keeps them up at night. And in the end, that's what makes this job so worthwhile.
It was surreal to get an impromptu tax lesson from Warren Buffett, but what I'll always remember is watching Hillary read that young man's collection of poetry as we rode home.
We meet brave and inspiring people everywhere we go—like that young man, and the countless others who shared their hopes and fears with us today.
And it's their stories that that make us want to get up and keep going, day after day.
Until next time!

Hillary Clinton Should Be Our Next President,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116801,Hillary Clinton,"We could keep going.
In 2016, we won't just choose our next president. America will choose a direction for our country on issues from gun violence prevention to women's rights to building an economy that helps the middle class get ahead—and stay ahead.
Hillary has proved she's the candidate who can take on tough fights and get things done. But that's not the only reason she should be our next president. Here are the first 112 reasons (and counting) that Hillary should be president.
What's your reason? Add it at the end of this post or text #IMWITHHER to 47246.
As a former secretary of state, U.S. senator, first lady, and a lifelong advocate for women and families, no one is more qualified to be president than Hillary.
Hillary knows child care, equal pay, and paid leave are fundamental economic issues—not just ""women's issues.""
Our democracy should work for everyone—not just the wealthy and well-connected.
Our next president could make multiple appointments to the Supreme Court.
We need comprehensive background checks on gun purchases.
She'll fight to overturn Citizens United to curb the outsized influence of big money in politics.
Because the wealthiest should pay their fair share in taxes.
We need comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to full and equal citizenship.
She's set a big goal: More than half a billion solar panels installed across the country by the end of her first term.
She's set another big goal: To generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within 10 years of her taking office.
The economy is stronger when a Democrat is in the White House.
Hillary will defend Planned Parenthood and women's health care from Republican attacks.
Hillary's New College Compact would mean students would never have to borrow to pay for tuition to attend a four-year public college in their state—and the millions of Americans who have student debt can refinance.
Because taxpayers shouldn't pay for millionaires' and billionaires' kids to go to college.
Guaranteed paid family leave.
She declared on the world stage that ""gay rights are human rights.""
Experts say Hillary's plan to keep Wall Street accountable is the toughest of all Democratic candidates.
As first lady, she helped get health care coverage for 8 million American children.
Our veterans should have access to timely and high quality health care.
She's the only Democrat with hedge-fund billionaires running ads against her—because they know her agenda is to stop their agenda.
After decades of fighting for progressive issues (and 11 straight hours of testimony in front of a Republican-led congressional committee), she's proved nobody can stand up to Republicans better than she can.
Hillary believes that raising middle-class incomes is the defining economic challenge of our time—and she has a plan to do just that.
Suspected terrorists, domestic abusers, other violent criminals, and the severely mentally ill shouldn't be able to purchase a gun.
Because every 4-year-old in America should be able to go to a high-quality preschool in the next 10 years.
We need to invest in infrastructure and rebuild or expand our roads, bridges, rail, broadband, public transit, and water and energy infrastructure.
We need to protect Americans' right to vote—not billionaires' and corporations' right to buy elections.
Have you seen the Republican debates?
Hillary will work to keep families together and defend President Obama's executive actions that protect DREAMers.
She has spent her life fighting for a fairer America.
She's been fighting for women and children her entire career—ever since she started working at the Children's Defense Fund after law school.
She believes we need a new and comprehensive commitment to equity and opportunity for communities of color.
She'll empower veterans and strengthen our economy and communities by connecting their unique skills to the jobs of the future.
Prescription drugs still cost too much. Hillary has a plan to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.
As senator, she championed the Paycheck Fairness Act and co-sponsored the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to help close the wage gap so women earn equal pay.
Community college should be tuition-free for every American.
It's time to close the Charleston loophole that lets otherwise prohibited individuals buy a gun if their background check is not complete in three days.
Hillary negotiated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that ended the rain of rockets on Israel.
Smart power is a smart strategy.
We need a president who will crack down on companies that send profits overseas to avoid paying their fair share.
She'll defend Social Security and Medicare against Republican attacks.
We need a president with a plan to protect the transgender community from violence.
If Congress continues its refusal to act on comprehensive immigration reform, Hillary has a plan to act—and do everything possible under the law to protect families.
She knows how to find common ground to get the job done—but also how to stand her ground.
Hillary is prepared to tackle all challenges, including national security—because presidents don't get to choose which issues come to their desks.
She has a plan to reform mandatory minimum sentencing.
We need a small-business president.
Because every American citizen should be automatically registered to vote when they turn 18, unless they opt out. Hillary will get it done.
She's a progressive—and she's a progressive who gets things done.
Immigration enforcement must be humane and targeted—and she'll end family detention and close private detention centers.
Hillary has a plan to reduce the risk of future financial crises.
Because we should hold corporations and individuals on Wall Street accountable—and prosecute them when they break the law.
She's one tough mother.
She fought for health care for 9/11 first responders as a U.S. senator—and she's been a vocal advocate for a permanent renewal of the Zadroga Act.
It's time to end for-profit private prisons in America.
The Affordable Care Act is working—but you could still use a lower co-pay and deductible.
Hillary will defend and fight to restore collective bargaining rights for workers.
She knows historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) serve an important public mission and will make a significant commitment to them.
We need to end the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine.
Because it's time to end conversion ""therapy"" for LGBT minors.
Hillary will put a stop to Republicans' systematic efforts to stop millions of people from voting.
We need a president who will fight to restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act after they were gutted by the Supreme Court.
Hillary helped negotiate the toughest sanctions Iran has ever faced.
She's earned the wrath of the gun lobby, Iran, pharmaceutical companies, and special interests—and that should tell you something about who she's fighting for.
She has a plan to invest in American manufacturing and revitalize communities that have lost manufacturing jobs.
She knows what's going on in Laos.
She believes we should let families buy into the Affordable Care Act health care exchanges regardless of immigration status.
Prison is not a substitute for treatment for drug addiction and mental health issues—Hillary knows that and will do something about it.
We can create a new national standard of no fewer than 20 days of early in-person voting in every state.
Because those at the top are doing just fine. It's your family who needs a fighter in the White House.
Hillary has a plan to combat America's deadly epidemic of drug and alcohol addiction.
In the words of former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: ""I've never met anyone more prepared to be president.""
She has a plan to make our financial system fairer and more accountable.
High-quality K?12 education needs to be a priority for every child in America.
As secretary of state, Hillary lobbied for the first-ever U.N. Human Rights Council resolution on LGBT human rights.
She made LGBT rights a priority of U.S. foreign policy.
In the words of the Advocate, Hillary has an ""awesome LGBT agenda"" to protect and expand LGBT rights.
She's not afraid to stand up to discriminatory attempts to roll back voting rights in places like Alabama.
Hillary knows Muslim Americans are helping our communities succeed and are our first, last, and best line of defense against radical jihadism.
Unlike the Republicans, Hillary will defend marriage equality nationwide.
She will provide funding to make sure body cameras are available to every police department in America to increase accountability on both sides of the lens.
Keith in New Hampshire
She'll expand on-campus child care and scholarships to help student parents balance going to school with raising a child.
The NRA has never helped Hillary get elected.
Her first major address as a presidential candidate was a call to end the ""era of mass incarceration.""
She'll fight to end racial profiling in America.
She'll hold irresponsible gun dealers and manufacturers fully accountable if they endanger Americans—and that includes repealing the gun industry's unique immunity protection.
She worked to expand the Family Medical Leave Act, allowing families of those wounded in service to their country to take leave in order to care for their loved ones.
Family members who care for ailing parents and grandparents could use some tax relief.
She has called out the Republicans' offensive, inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric because she knows it's against our values as Americans—and our national security.
Because when a company does well, the employees who helped produce those profits deserve a share in them—not just CEOs.
She believes we should use alternatives to incarceration for low-level, nonviolent marijuana users, and she will reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule II substance.
She's not afraid to to call out Republicans for blocking efforts to keep guns from suspected terrorists.
She helped lead the charge to raise the minimum wage as a senator.
Building international coalitions advances our values, interests, and makes the world safer. Hillary is the only candidate who's actually done it.
She worked across the aisle to expand health care access for members of the National Guard and reservists—making sure those who served and their families had access to health care when they returned home.
We should put American families over the gun lobby—and Hillary is not afraid to stand up to the NRA.
There are cities across the country that are already leading on climate change—so she'll launch a Clean Energy Challenge that will form new partnerships with states, cities, and rural communities.
She'll ""ban the box"" so people who have a past conviction can get a fair shot at employment.
When Hillary was secretary of state, the U.S. extended antiretroviral therapy—which helps HIV/AIDS patients live longer, healthier lives—to 78 countries.
Businesses should be encouraged to train and hire apprentices.
The nation's leading advocates for gun violence prevention have said Hillary's plan is the right strategy.
Because women's rights are human rights.
Because even when people didn't want her to go to China and stand up for human rights at the 1995 U.N. Conference on Women in Beijing, she did it anyway.
Because a woman's place is in the White House.
Donald Trump. Enough said.

We've heard a lot of slogans and shorthand from presidential candidates talking about taking on ISIS.
Here's what that conversation sounds like from someone who understands the complexities of the situation in Syria and the relationships we need to build to win.

Hillary is right: ""Gay rights are human rights."" Period.
While Republicans are attempting to roll back LGBT rights, Hillary's moving forward—because even though marriage equality is now the law of the land, we still have a lot of work to do to ensure that all LGBT Americans are treated equally under the law.
Hillary has a plan to strengthen LGBT rights as president. Here's what she'll do, and why it matters.
In 31 states, people can get married on a Sunday—and then are at risk of being fired because of their sexual orientation on Monday. We cannot allow discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people to go unchecked in this country.?
Hillary has called on Congress to pass the Equality Act, and also supports efforts underway in the courts and in the federal government to clarify that discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation is a form of illegal sex discrimination. She will not stop fighting until we secure full equality for LGBT Americans.
Conversion therapy is the harmful practice of trying to ""cure"" LGBT and gender-questioning young people. We should be providing LGBT kids with love, support, and compassion—not trying to change their identities.?
Hillary will support efforts in Congress and the states to end conversion therapy for minors.
We have to address the growing crisis of violence against transgender Americans.?
This year, at least 22 transgender women—primarily, women of color—have been murdered. And that doesn't take into account the violence that goes unreported or ignored. People should not have to live in fear because of who they are.?Hillary will work with the Department of Justice and the FBI to gather better data on these hate crimes, so that we have more information about this violence—and can put a stop to it.
Being a good parent has nothing to do with sexual orientation or gender identity. Yet adoption by same-sex couples remains illegal in Mississippi, and even in states where adoption is technically legal, LGBT individuals still face discrimination.
This is not only unfair to would-be parents, but also hurts the hundreds of thousands of children in foster care, who are ready to become part of loving families.?Hillary will urge Congress to pass the Every Child Deserves a Family Act, a law that would prohibit federally funded child welfare agencies from discriminating against potential foster or adoptive families because of sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status.
Studies have shown that pre-exposure prophylaxis (also know as PrEP) is incredibly effective at preventing HIV infection when used as directed.?
Hillary will make sure that at-risk communities—including transgender individuals and black men who have sex with men (MSM)—have access to PrEP, by increasing the government's investment in building awareness of and access to the drug.
Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress failed to renew the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act, which provided federal funding for homeless prevention resources, emergency shelters, street outreach, transitional living, and rural assistance.?
A disproportionate number of homeless youth are LGBT, and many of them feel like they don't have anywhere to turn. Hillary will work with Congress to to ensure adequate funding—and safe, welcoming shelter—for homeless youth.
The stakes for LGBT rights are high in this election.
Republican presidential candidates seem determined to undo the progress our nation has made. Every top-tier Republican presidential candidate opposes marriage equality—and Marco Rubio has even suggested he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn it. They've gone on the record against anti-discrimination protections for the LGBT community, and some even oppose LGBT couples adopting.
We've celebrated huge gains for the LGBT community in recent years. Now we must work together to protect our progress and make sure we have more to celebrate in the years to come—not hand over the Oval Office to someone who will turn back the clock on LGBT equality.

Hillary took the stage for the third debate of the Democratic primary—and she showed that no one is more prepared to be commander in chief and to keep America safe. She tackled everything from substance use disorders and addiction to destroying ISIS and global terror to raising incomes and preventing another financial crisis. Here are some of her best moments, as live-sketched by New York City-based artist Julia Rothman.
She called for commonsense laws to keep guns out of the wrong hands.
Hillary: ""I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.""
She had the perfect response to this question. Moderator: ""Should corporate America love Hillary Clinton?""
Hillary: ""Everybody should!""
She outlined tough reforms to rein in Wall Street.
Hillary: ""There are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire. They started in Iowa. Now, you'd have to ask yourself why are they running ads against me? And the answer is because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda.""
She defended the Affordable Care Act—and laid out a plan to improve it.
Hillary: ""We have fought, as Democrats, for decades to get a health care plan. I know. I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s. We want to build on it and fix it.""

Some texters admire her fight against the gun lobby.
Others know she's the best choice for our economy.

Lots of support came from people who know she's got the experience to be commander in chief.
Plenty of texters told us that her plan to make college affordable and take on education debt would change their lives.
Tons of people brought up their families.
Many are invested in the fights she's been waging for years.
Some of the texts were super sweet.
But, by far, the most touching responses were the ones about Hillary building a world where our children believe they can do anything.

She's always happy to talk about her ""beautiful, perfect"" granddaughter, she's an eager volunteer for babysitting duty, and whenever she travels around the country, she makes sure to bring back a gift for Charlotte—sound familiar?
Here are seven more ways Hillary is just like your grandmother.?
She worries about children everywhere ...
"" You shouldn't have to be the granddaughter of a former president to be able to live up to your God-given potential in America. You should be able to be the granddaughter of a factory worker or the grandson of a truck driver—and every day as your president, I'm going to get up trying to figure out what more I can do to make sure every person, and particularly every child, has a chance to do just that.""Hillary Clinton
She knows what's best ...
The science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork. Let's protect all our kids. #GrandmothersKnowBest— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 3, 2015
She reacts this way when people le faltan el respeto ...?
She reads to you before bedtime ...?
I believe getting off to a good start should be our children's birthright, part of the basic bargain that we have with each other as a nation. Every child should have the tools and the skills to thrive in tomorrow's economy.—Hillary
She isn't afraid to talk about the importance of el respeto (especially when it comes to women) ...
"" Mr. Trump insults and dismisses women. ... And, you know, whenever he is pressed about the things he says about women, he says he loves women. In fact, to quote him, he cherishes us. Well, if it's all the same to you, Mr. Trump, I would rather you stop cherishing women and start respecting women.""Hillary Clinton
She likes to highlight accomplishments ...
and she had one word for Donald Trump ...?

While celebrating the Supreme Court's marriage equality decision this June, something occurred to Clara in West Branch, Iowa: The rainbow Hillary logo would look beautiful on a quilt.
Clara saw an opportunity to bring together a community of quilters and Hillary supporters. So she put out a call on Facebook—and within hours, she was assembling a team to help her with her project.
The first nine people who showed up had never held a needle, but the group quickly formed a close-knit community. They'd meet twice a week to work on the quilt—and as they stitched, they'd read an excerpt from Hard Choices and discuss what a Hillary presidency would mean for the future of our country.
""This is a supporter quilt,"" says Clara. ""It's kind of a way to say to Hillary: ?We've got your back.'""
A weekly team meeting of the Hillary Quilt Project
As the patchwork came together, word of the quilt spread. People from across Iowa added their names to the quilt. National and local media did stories about the quilters—and before long, Hillary was there to meet the team.
And of course, sign her own name.
Hillary meets Clara and Linda, founders of the Hillary Quilt Project
A few months later, Hillary's husband added his signature, too.
The quilt now lives at Clara's home in West Branch, making appearances at organizing events, town halls, and house parties.
Clara has big dreams for the future of the quilt. She's hoping it'll end up in a presidential library ... or 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
(Sew good.)

Hillary just announced a bold new $2 billion annual commitment to prevent, effectively treat, and make an Alzheimer's cure possible by 2025—and to provide needed relief to Alzheimer's patients and their families.
That would change life for millions of Americans—including Keith and his mother.
Keith's mother is one of the 5 million Americans suffering from Alzheimer's, and he can't afford to hire a caregiver for her during the day. So Keith brings his mother with him to the library where he works, in order to keep an eye on her. It's the only thing he can do.
It's the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States, but we have no known cure for Alzheimer's, or even means of prevention. And each year, the number of people suffering from Alzheimer's grows—nearly 15 million Americans will suffer from the disease by 2050.
According to the Alzheimer's Association, almost everything we know about this disease has been learned over the last 15 years. That's thanks in large measure to significant federal investment in research programs. But that research is chronically underfunded.
So what inspired Hillary to make this commitment? Caregiving has been a cause near and dear to her heart for a long time ...
"" My mother lived with us for the end of her life, and having her there was just an amazing blessing for me. It was such a joy to have her in my home. ... But I also know it was a sense of responsibility. Thankfully she was in pretty good health until she passed, but there were hospitalizations. There were doctor's appointments, the kinds of things that happen in every family that I know of. For a lot of caregivers though, it is much, much more than that.""Hillary Clinton
And as she heard from people all over the country who were caring for loved ones or working around the clock to provide care as a home care worker, she knew she had to do something.
"" I met a woman in one of my town halls in New Hampshire. ... She said that she was taking care of her husband who has Alzheimer's and her mother who has Alzheimer's. Same house, one woman taking care of both. She said, 'Look, I will do it. I want to do it. I love my husband and my mother. But isn't there any help I could get? We're spending all of our savings. We don't know how we're going to do this.' We've got to figure out how we're going to help.""Hillary Clinton
When Keith got the opportunity to meet Hillary backstage before a speech, he told her about his mother and how hard their family is struggling to provide care for her.
""I wasn't planning to talk to her about that,"" he said after the meeting. ""But in the moment, I was so moved by her commitment to fighting for better health care that I had to thank her.""
""I was surprised that she got emotional,"" he added. ""I never expected her to care that much about someone she just met. But we connected, and I could tell that she really cared. It was so moving.""
As a nation, we have to do more to support our elders, and the families that care for them. We have to invest in research and scientific discovery. And we have to do everything we can to make the lives of our caregivers easier. Hillary will invest in the future and motivate change. It's time to make a cure possible.

1. She led the U.S. delegation to the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, where she cast a global spotlight on violence against women.
2. She co-convened a White House Summit on School Violence after the mass shooting at Columbine High School and supported the Brady Bill.
3. She worked with Republicans and Democrats to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which now provides health coverage to more than 8 million kids and cut the uninsured rate for American children in half.
4. She helped pass the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which improved the foster care system and provided new financial incentives for states to move children to permanent adoptive homes. The number of adoptions from foster care doubled across the country within five years of its passage.
5. She hosted the White House Conferences on Early Childhood Development and Child Care to encourage early learning.
6. She hosted the first-ever White House Convening on Latino Children and Youth to help ensure Latino children have the opportunities succeed.
7. She fought for veterans suffering from Gulf War syndrome, urging a presidential commission to investigate why thousands of veterans came home from the Persian Gulf War with illness and ailments.

Welcome to Keota, a town of 996 people in eastern Iowa.
Three high school students from Keota—Abby, Megan, and Kylea—wanted Hillary to visit their school.
So they started a Twitter account, @KeotaSociology, to persuade Hillary to come speak with them about the issues facing their community—including the shrinking resources of many rural schools.
As an agricultural based community, one of the things we would love to hear about is @HillaryClinton 's rural policy #KeotaHopesForHillary ????— KeotaHopesForHillary (@KeotaSociology) October 8, 2015

The girls drove 100 miles to see Hillary speak at the Iowa Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in October—and made their way to the front of the rope line to meet her.

And a few weeks later at town hall in Coralville, the girls raised their hand to ask a question—and Hillary called on them.
?My name's Megan, and we're from southeast Iowa, and part of #KeotaHopesForHillary,? Megan said.
?I'm coming!? Hillary responded. ?I'm coming to Keota. I am coming. Anybody who can organize such a really well-planned effort to get me to visit, I think you deserve it.?
Tonight @HillaryClinton told us she will be visiting our high school. We are honored. #KeotaHopesForHillary we did it!!!!— KeotaHopesForHillary (@KeotaSociology) November 3, 2015
And then she did.
On Tuesday, December 22, Hillary visited the Keota Community School. Seven hundred people (nearly the whole town!) packed into the school's gymnasium to see her speak.
Abby, Megan, and Kylea—as well as their sociology teacher, Mr. Snakenberg—introduced her to the crowd.
?Hillary Clinton is paying attention to the little guy today,? said Abby, a 17-year-old senior who will be a caucus precinct captain for Hillary. ?And that's amazing.?
?That was just an incredible introduction,? Hillary said, ?but I have to give you the story that's behind the scenes.
?I started seeing these young women showing up at my events, and they were holding signs inviting me to Keota. You really made an impression on me. And one time, after I finished an event, I was shaking hands and they were there and said, ?Would you come to our school?'
?I don't want to make a promise I can't keep, so I said, ?Well, I'll try.' And then the next time I saw them, they were at another event, holding their signs, raising their hands, and as I was calling on them, I said, ?I'm really coming. I will come to Keota.'
?So, to Abby and Megan and Kylea—and to your teacher, Schuyler, because it takes a teacher to inspire this kind of activism by students—thank you for having me.?
Keota hoped for Hillary—and #KeotaGotHillary.

11 million Americans rely on caretakers—the folks whose job it is to step in when you, or your loved ones, are most vulnerable. Caretakers do an enormous service to patients and families who need help providing care, and Regina Sutton is one of them.
Regina is a professional caretaker, which means she takes care of people with serious medical needs. She takes on the everyday tasks that to most seem routine—getting dressed, preparing meals, cutting food, and taking patients to their doctors' appointments.?
Caretaking is more than just a day job. It's part spiritual, part hard work, but most of all it's about showing compassion to those who need it most.?
Sometimes, Regina takes on extra tasks like spending an extra hour sweeping the floor or cleaning up the kitchen because she knows that if she doesn't do it, it won't get done.?
Despite the monumental responsibility, caretakers are chronically underpaid, with some making as little as little as $7.25, the minimum wage, and the average care worker making just over $9.00 an hour.?
If they aren't feeling well, they face a moral dilemma: stay home, and there's a chance nobody else can take care of their patient.
Worse still, many home care workers don't have benefits like paid leave.
A few months ago, Regina had the opportunity to sit down with Hillary Clinton alongside other caretakers to talk about the challenges they face.?
"" We were all nervous. I personally felt a little starstruck. ... When Secretary Clinton walked in and said ?We are just going to have a conversation,' it was a relief.""—Regina Sutton
There were tears as caretakers from around the country shared their stories.
"" And right now I'm hitting on 60 years old. It's going to be my turn to be the client. And what is there for me? Nothing, if I quit tomorrow I have nothing. I have nothing to show for 42 years of my life working for people. And that's what I do. I mean I don't give it up. Everybody tells me why don't you quit? I can't. It's my passion. And I feel for those people that are left in their homes all day and nobody knows what they're going through. ...[W]e're the only people that they see. So we're their miracle workers. But, my thing is I don't care how long I've been doing it, when I leave and they give you a smile that's all I need.""—Lulu G.
"" [I]n my career of being a home care worker, I've had two babies and both via C-section. And I had to return to work a week after having a C-section. And I just really don't think that anybody should have to make that choice either to take care of themselves or put food on the table.""—Summer S.
Hillary listened to the stories and summed up how anybody would feel after hearing them.
—Hillary Clinton
That's why Hillary has a plan to invest in what she calls the ""caring economy,"" which recognizes the value of family caregivers and home care workers.?
As president, she'll provide tax relief to family members who care for ailing parents and grandparents. She'll launch a Care Workers Initiative to coordinate efforts across the federal government, expand Social Security benefits to caregivers, and build on the Caregiver Respite program to make sure families who provide full-time care also have the opportunity to care for themselves.
It's the least we can do for the unsung heroes among us who work to bring hope to those in need.

322,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5002,"December 23, 2015",Press Release - We Can Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's in 10 Years. Here's How Hillary Clinton Plans To Do It,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116881,Hillary Clinton,"A candidate on the side of science.
More than a century after Alzheimer's was identified, there is still no cure and no effective treatment. With a new diagnosis every minute, Alzheimer's is a looming public health disaster (and one that already costs us $200 billion annually).
That's why Hillary Clinton just rolled out a plan to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's by 2025—and make a cure possible. It's an ambitious goal, but one the scientific community believes is possible and necessary. Here's what you need to know about this medical moon shot.
Scientists have made major advances in Alzheimer's research.
We've learned nearly everything we know about Alzheimer's in the past 15 years—particularly after researchers, led by Dr. Rudy Tanzi of Harvard University, created ""Alzheimer's in a dish""—human nerve cells, made from stem cells, meant to replicate a human brain environment.
For the first time, scientists were able to state conclusively that Alzheimer's can be traced to a substance called amyloid plaque in the brain—which starts to build up well before a patient begins to notice any memory loss. Amyloid plaques lead to tangles in the brain (another way to develop tangles is through multiple concussions, like NFL players do). Once tangles form, nerve cells in the brain begin to die and spark inflammation. Inflammation, the body's attempt to defend the brain from tangles, actually causes more cell death, particularly in the part of the brain needed for short-term memory.
This was a major finding, and it explained why treatments targeting amyloids in patients with full-blown Alzheimer's were failing—because they should have been treated much earlier. As Dr. Tanzi explains it, ""This is like giving a patient with congestive heart failure treatment for cholesterol. You had to do that 20 years before to be effective.""
Doctors and medical researchers can now see amyloid plaque in the brain and evidence of tangles—and they can predict, in most cases, if a person is on their way to Alzheimer's two decades before they show signs. But as Dr. Tanzi notes, ""What good is predicting that if you can't help them?""
Current treatments don't stop the disease.
Remember, there is no treatment that will either prevent or effectively treat this disease. Current drugs provide a very mild benefit—and only for a short time—while the Alzheimer's brain continues to go downhill.
Ten years could make all the difference. ""There's so much we already know,"" says Dr. Virginia Lee of the University of Pennsylvania. ""With additional funding, we could treat patients who are cognitively normal who might be on their way to Alzheimer's, so they don't develop cognitive impairment for a long time. We could start combination therapy [targeting amyloids, tangles, and inflammation]. And we could prevent Alzheimer's from developing in the first place.""
""If we could not wait to treat people who have already lost their memories,"" adds her colleague Dr. John Trojanowski. ""That would be a very important accomplishment.""
Alzheimer's research isn't constrained by knowledge—only budget.
It comes down to funding (more specifically: lack of funding).
""Most of what we're doing in terms of understanding the disease, from the models we're making to the drug discovery process, is based on genes we found in the ?80s and ?90s,"" says Dr. Tanzi. ""But since then, we've learned about two dozen more Alzheimer's genes, thanks to modern genome work. But we don't have the money to work on it—that's why we're working on the tried-and-true genes from 20 years ago.""
""Alzheimer's in a dish,"" which revolutionized how researchers understand the disease and how they're thinking about treatment and prevention, was funded by the private Cure Alzheimer's Fund. Just think what researchers could do with Hillary's proposed $2 billion a year.
Can it be done in 10 years?
It's possible—thanks to a confluence of research, rapidly advancing technology, and an emerging consensus on the cause of the disease and its progression. ""Alzheimer's research clinical trials are taking off,"" says Dr. Trojanowski. ""Investing in this point in time is perfect. Twenty years ago we didn't know enough. Right now we can do it. We have the ideas, and we have the people.""
The missing part of the equation is a major federal investment. That's why Hillary is pledging to invest $2 billion each year for a decade, to help find the elusive treatment and prevention plan—and maybe even a cure—that has evaded scientists.
That kind of ambitious thinking is exactly what we need, says the head of MD Anderson Cancer Center, Dr. Ronald DePinho, who launched a moon shots program for cancer. ""Her proposal will yield new diagnostics and therapeutics capable of bending the arc of this dreaded disease,"" he says. ""No one can predict when these breakthroughs occur, but we do know that Secretary Clinton's bold proposal will get us there faster.""
For the families of 5.4 million Americans, it can't come soon enough.

President Obama just made an emotional call to stop gun violence in America—and backed it up by announcing executive actions intended to curb the epidemic of violence that's taking more than 33,000 American lives every year.
These are important steps that will respect the Second Amendment while working to protect our families and communities from gun violence. But there's more we have to do—and it's going to require all of us to stand up and say, ""Enough.""
That means demanding more from our elected officials.
""All of us need to demand a Congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby's lies."" —@POTUS #StopGunViolence— The White House (@WhiteHouse) January 5, 2016
That means standing up to the gun lobby.
The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage, but they can't hold America hostage. We can't accept this carnage in our communities.— President Obama (@POTUS) January 4, 2016
And that means voting. If you want to defend President Obama's actions to help prevent gun violence from taking more American lives, you have to vote in this election—because the Republicans running for president would rip away these executive actions and the progress we've made.
""We need voters who want safer gun laws, and who are disappointed in leaders who stand in the way, to remember come election time."" —@POTUS— The White House (@WhiteHouse) January 5, 2016

When President Clinton hit the trail to campaign for Hillary for the first time, he shared memories from when he and Hillary first met, almost 45 years ago.
The two met for the first time while attending Yale Law School. ""Unlike now,"" he said, ""where more than half the law students in America are women, then they were a distinct minority.""
""And there she was at Yale Law School. She could have written her ticket to go anywhere she wanted ...""
""When we got out, she could have gone to work at a big law firm, get a fancy clerkship,"" President Clinton said. But instead of taking a high-paying legal job, Hillary went to work for the most vulnerable communities.
""There was a nice story in the press you may have seen in the last several days, talking about a trip she took to Alabama to see if these so-called tax exempt private schools were really just segregation academies and therefore not entitled to the tax exemption.
""I valued even more a trip she took to South Carolina to see why so many African American children were being held in adult prisons. It's hard to remember 40 years ago what things were like.""
For more than four decades, President Clinton has seen Hillary fight for these things. And this is what she'll fight for as president.

Something unprecedented just happened: Both the House and the Senate voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and defund Planned Parenthood.
Their votes will not change the law. More than 18 million people will not lose the health insurance they gained through the Affordable Care Act. The millions of women who depend on Planned Parenthood for health care will not lose access to lifesaving preventive care, including cancer screenings, well-woman exams, HIV tests, and more.
And that is because there is a Democrat in the White House.
But a year from now, a new president will be sworn in. If that president is a Republican, today's votes would have had a very different outcome—because every single Republican running for president wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and defund Planned Parenthood.
He or she would sign the bill and take us back to the days when insurers could charge women more than men for the exact same coverage, or deny coverage because of pre-existing conditions. He or she would deny funding to a trusted health care provider that is often the only place that women can get the critical health services they need.

Hillary Clinton has always fought to fix the problems that keep families up at night—and for millions of families, autism is a major issue in their lives.
An estimated 3.5 million Americans—including one in 68 children—have autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Many go undiagnosed for years, and services that would vastly improve their lives are unaffordable for most families.
That's why Hillary just announced a broad plan to help people of all ages and their families who are impacted by autism.
Here's what it will do:
1. Launch a national early screening campaign
Diagnosis is the first step in helping people with autism. Yet, studies show that in many children, especially girls and African American and Latino children, early signs of autism go overlooked for months or even years. Hillary's plan will boost early screening rates so that kids can get diagnosed and receive the services that will make a difference in their lives.
2.?Ensure health insurance coverage for autism services
When autism services aren't covered by insurance, many families can't afford them. The Affordable Care Act has gone a long way to help those with autism get the support they need—by making it illegal for insurance companies to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, ending lifetime dollar limits on benefits, and allowing young adults to remain on their parents' coverage until the age of 26.
3. Invest in research to deepen our understanding of autism
We need to invest in more research to better understand autism, create better diagnostic tools, and improve treatments and services for people on the autism spectrum. Hillary will significantly increase funding for autism-related research and call for the first-ever study of the prevalence of adult autism.
4. Increase employment opportunities for those with autism
People with autism are unemployed at a much higher rate: More than half of youth with autism are not getting a job or pursuing higher education in the two years after they graduate high school. Hillary's plan will work to close the employment gap by launching a new Autism Works Initiative that will include a post-graduation transition plan for every student with autism, along with a public-private partnership to connect people with autism to employment opportunities.

Hillary is the only candidate with a?comprehensive plan?to support Americans with autism. And her proposals are drawing praise from advocates and families alike.

Republicans in Congress just voted again to defund Planned Parenthood—and if we had a Republican president right now, millions of Americans would lose access to basic health care. So in 2016, this country faces a choice: Let Republicans take their assault on reproductive health and rights all the way to the White House, or fight back.The reality is, Republican presidential candidates don't just have bad records—they're tripping over themselves to brag about who will do more damage to women's health if they get elected. We have to make sure they don't get the chance.Here are a few of the reasons why a Republican president would be very, very bad news for women:
Planned Parenthood
It's not just Republicans in Congress. Every single Republican presidential candidate has vowed to defund Planned Parenthood, which would cut off millions of patients' access to life-saving preventive care, including cancer screenings, well-woman exams, STI and HIV tests, and more.
Today's vote proves that it's never been more critical to have a president who stands with Planned Parenthood. You won't find that person in the Republican field.
Safe and legal abortion
Last year alone, Republicans in Congress voted numerous times to chip away at women's reproductive rights. And Republican presidential candidates are on the same mission: Every single one of them supports efforts to restrict women's access to safe and legal abortion, and some even oppose abortion in cases of rape, incest, or to protect a woman's health.
In other words: If Congress sends a bill restricting women's reproductive rights to a Republican president, you can bet he or she will sign it—and with as many as four Supreme Court seats opening up within the next president's term in office, the right to safe and legal abortion itself could hang in the balance.
Access to birth control?
All of the Republican presidential candidates have pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act—which makes birth control and preventive care available at no out-of-pocket cost.
To make matters worse, many of the Republican candidates for president applauded the Supreme Court's recent Hobby Lobby decision, which lets bosses impose their personal beliefs on their employees' birth control options. Instead of protecting and expanding access to birth control the way President Obama has done, a Republican president would put it back out of reach for millions of women.
The Affordable Care Act
Republican candidates have made it crystal clear: Each one of them, if elected, will waste no time in tearing up the Affordable Care Act, kicking 18 million Americans off their health care plans, and ripping away all the progress we've made. That means taking us back to the days when insurers could charge women more than men for the exact same health coverage. It means going back to insurers denying women coverage because of ""pre-existing conditions"" like breast cancer, pregnancy, or domestic violence (seriously). And it means forcing women to go back to paying hundreds of dollars a year for basic health care, like cancer screenings and birth control.
It's 2016, and Republican candidates still think they have the right to interfere in decisions that should be made by women in consultation with their doctors."

Viola Davis raised an important truth about racial justice and opportunity.

America Ferrera fought back against bigotry and anti-immigrant rhetoric.

Aqualyn Kennedy had a stroke when she was 18 years old.
""I was walking to class, and all of a sudden the left side of my body went numb, and I couldn't form words,"" she says. ""It was the first time I had ever been sick. I was so scared.""
Aqualyn recovered from her stroke, but her health problems persisted.
A few years later, she began experiencing what she thought was horrible stomach pain. It turned out that her gallbladder needed to be removed, and she ended up spending a week in the hospital.
When her insurance company got the bill for her stay, she was dropped. Immediately.
Aqualyn says that even though the issue with her gallbladder was unrelated, her insurance company viewed her earlier health problems as a so-called ""pre-existing condition""—which, at the time, was grounds for taking away her coverage.
Aqualyn was left without health care and responsible for paying the full bill for her week-long hospital stay. She tried to find a different company to cover her, but every time Aqualyn applied for coverage, she was rejected.
What the insurance company did to Aqualyn was allowed—and shockingly common.
Nearly half of Americans have pre-existing conditions—something they consulted with a doctor about or were treated for before they got coverage. More than 400 diagnoses or medical conditions can be considered pre-existing—from depression to cancer to pregnancy.
Before the Affordable Care Act was signed, there were no rules against what Aqualyn's insurance company did. And it happened to hundreds of thousands of people.
Insurance companies denied Aqualyn because her pre-existing condition made her too risky to cover. This was commonplace at the time: Between 2007 and 2009, the four largest health insurance companies in the country denied health care coverage to more than 600,000 people because of pre-existing conditions—and the percentage of applicants being rejected was rising sharply every year.
As first lady, Hillary Clinton fought against this kind of behavior from insurance companies.
Hillary believes that quality, affordable health care is a basic human right.
In the '90s, she fought hard to bring universal health care to the United States—and took on the insurance companies to do it.
When Congress defeated health care reform, she refused to give up, going on to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which now covers more than 8 million children.
Almost two decades later President Obama finally won the battle for health care reform and signed the Affordable Care Act.
Hillary and President Obama celebrating when the Affordable Care Act was passed.
The Affordable Care Act didn't just bring health care to 18 million Americans: It stopped insurance companies from rejecting people with pre-existing conditions.
Once health reform was enacted, Aqualyn was able to feel secure in her health care for the first time.
""I felt like a huge burden had been lifted off of my shoulders,"" she says. ""My care was finally protected. I was so grateful that Secretary Clinton and the president were out there fighting to pass this law and speaking up for people like me,"" Aqualyn says. But a Republican president would repeal the Affordable Care Act, putting the health of millions of Americans in danger.
Just this week, both the House and the Senate voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and let insurance companies return to rejecting people with pre-existing conditions.
We can't afford to let Republicans undo all of President Obama's hard work."

Shortly after launching her campaign for president, Hillary Clinton delivered a speech at Columbia University about the inequities in our criminal justice system—and she laid out a broad plan for reform.
Here are 9 ways Hillary will reform our criminal justice system.
Unnecessary incarceration tears families apart. We need to reform mandatory minimum sentences and support mental health and drug treatment programs so that low-level, nonviolent offenders who stay clean can avoid prison.
"" When people see that respect and trust are two-way streets, they're more likely to work hand-in-hand with law enforcement.""
Policing has to be constitutional to be effective. Period. That's why Hillary is calling for smart policing strategies that will help rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve, like:
Hillary believes police body cameras will go a long way to improve transparency and accountability on both sides of the lens.
"" African American men are far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men—10 percent longer for the same crimes in the federal system.""
We need to end to racial profiling once and for all—and prohibit law enforcement from relying on race in routine stops and investigations where there is no information linking a person to a crime.
Hillary will make new investments to ensure law enforcement officials are properly trained on issues like implicit bias, conflict resolution, and use of force so they're equipped to protect their own safety and the safety of others.
We need to reform mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines that keep nonviolent drug offenders in prison longer than they need to be. Hillary will give judges more discretion over sentencing, cut the mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders in half, and eliminate the disparity between sentences for crack and powder cocaine possession.
Our prison system is the federal government's responsibility—and shouldn't be contracted out to private corporations. As president, Hillary will close private prisons and immigrant detention centers.
Many job and housing applications require people to check a box if they have a criminal record. That closes opportunities for former prisoners. As president, Hillary will ""ban the box"" so that applicants for jobs with the federal government and federal contractors have an opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications before being asked about their criminal records.
Fixing our criminal justice system isn't enough—we have to address the underlying challenges that families face, like finding affordable child care and quality schools. That's why Hillary is fighting to raise incomes, make college affordable, and provide better economic opportunities for every American.
Hillary has fought inequality throughout her career. As a young attorney working for the Children's Defense Fund, she saw first hand how our legal system can sometimes fail those who need it most. And she has been been working to change that ever since.

That Should Terrify You,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116894,Hillary Clinton,"A Republican president would shape Supreme Court decisions for decades to come.
The next president of the United States will almost certainly fill one or more vacancies on the Supreme Court.?
That means they'll have the power to influence laws for decades to come.
The average Supreme Court justice retires at around age 79. When the next president is sworn into office, three of the current justices on the bench will be over the age of 80.
Right now, the court is hearing arguments for Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, a case that could harm unions and undermine the foundation of collective bargaining rights. The decision in this case will directly impact millions of American workers.
And in this term, the Supreme Court will also rule on the future of voting rights, women's health, affirmative action, and immigration. The fate of America's most fundamental rights may depend on the person (or people) our next president chooses.
In an op-ed for the Boston Globe, Hillary Clinton lays out why the stakes are so high:
These aren't hypothetical scenarios: These cases will be in front of the Supreme Court this term and in the years to come. And one new conservative justice would be enough to tip the scales, because many important Supreme Court cases are decided by just one vote—including the case that made marriage equality the law of the land.
The Republican presidential candidates each have a vision for who they will appoint to the Supreme Court—and it's terrifying.
They want to stack the court with justices who will put constitutional rights in jeopardy. If the next president is a Republican, Americans could lose access to affordable health care, reproductive rights, and same-sex marriage in just a few short years.
Hillary understands the court's power to review and interpret our laws—but unlike the Republicans, she won't appoint justices who will move our country backwards.
A Republican president could stack the Supreme Court with justices who will rip away all of the progress we've made as a nation. We can't afford to let that happen.

As a Navy fighter pilot, NASA astronaut, and registered Independent, Mark never spent much time caring about the ""who's up, who's down"" of partisan politics.?
A registered Republican when I was younger, I was always committed to Southern Arizona values: independence, freedom, and common sense.When the Republican Party began to veer away from its core values, I ran for office as a proud Democrat.?
When I served my community in the Arizona legislature and later in Congress, I joined other like-minded Democrats and Republicans to work for energy independence, military readiness, a better life for our military families and returning soldiers, a woman's right to have freedom over her own health choices, and a more secure border.
Today, during our second chance at service, Mark and I continue to fight for what we've always fought for: independence, freedom, and common sense. That's why we're fighting for a Congress and White House that stand up to the corporate gun lobby's intimidation and bullying. And that's why, today, we are endorsing Hillary Clinton for president.
For far too long, the gun lobby has had a stranglehold on Washington. Members of Congress and even some of our presidents have been intimidated into inaction. Bipartisan action has been blocked. Loopholes in our laws that let dangerous people get guns have been fiercely protected. Lies have been spread, fears have been stoked, and a dangerous, unacceptable status quo has been furthered, all while gun sales have skyrocketed.?
Throughout all of this, the corporate gun lobby has moved further and further away from the gun owners they claim to represent.?
Most of the people running for president talk a lot about how tough they are. But most of them have shown they aren't tough enough to stand up to the gun lobbyists.
Take it from me: Talk is cheap.
In fact, a lot of the people running for president seem downright terrified to even have a rational conversation about the problem of gun violence in America. We've listened closely to all of them, and we've looked at all of their records.Only one candidate for president has the determination and toughness to stand up to the corporate gun lobby—and the record to prove it. That candidate is Hillary Clinton.
Time and time again, Hillary has done and said what is right, not what is politically expedient. That's why Mark and I are supporting her for president of the United States.
As a United States senator, Hillary voted for laws that keep guns out of the wrong hands and make our communities safer places to live. She voted against protecting gun manufacturers at all costs and insisted on putting the safety of our communities over manufacturers' bottom lines. And we believe that as president she will continue working to respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners like us while working to achieve practical solutions like a reliable background check system that prevents dangerous people from getting guns, closing loopholes to protect women and families by keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and stalkers, and cracking down on the illegal gun trade.?
Hillary and I share a proud tradition of women leading on issues that impact all Americans and getting things done. We have taken on tough races, relied on other strong women to have our backs—and we have never, ever shied away from a tough fight or a tough vote.
Today, Mark and I are proud to have Hillary's back, and to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with her to, once and for all, break the stranglehold the corporate gun lobby has had on American politics—and American families—for too long.?
Speaking is still physically difficult for me. I do hours and hours of speech therapy. And in January, I hope to call my friend Hillary ""Madam President."""

At tonight's State of the Union address, one chair will remain empty in honor of the victims of gun violence who no longer have a voice. My daughter, Ana Grace M?rquez-Greene, is one of them.
Our family has to live with an empty chair every day—for the rest of our days.
Ana lost her voice on December 14, 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School. She was 6 years old. And the empty chair she left behind brings us to our knees every day—but it must not silence us.
For three years and 28 days our family has honored Ana's legacy through the nonprofit foundation we founded in her name, which focuses on trauma awareness and social isolation to prevent violence. But there is more work to do.
Although we have made great strides with our foundation, and my husband has even been nominated for two Grammys for his musical tribute to Ana, these are bittersweet honors.
All we ever wanted to do was be parents and have a family. Our surviving son was only 8 at the time of his sister's murder.
And so we support President Barack Obama's recent executive actions. Although it may be too late to save our Ana, we believe that every life is precious. And we should do all we can to protect American families—in every community—from these losses.
Barack Obama started the work—and I believe Hillary Clinton will finish it.
We are now at a crossroads in America—a tipping point on gun violence. And we need a candidate that will balance Second Amendment protection with the protection of human life. We need a rational, forward-moving conversation to address this issue. And we must not get stuck in partisan rhetoric.
Love wins. And it also saves lives.

On whether she supports efforts to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which makes it more difficult for low-income women to exercise their full reproductive rights:
""If state governments [or] politicians use their power to try to restrict that right, well-off people are still going to have it ... . But a lot of poorer women, rural women—isolated far from a place that they can get services—are going to be denied.""

President Obama recently announced that he's going to take executive action to strengthen background checks and make it harder for dealers to sell guns to criminals. That's a commonsense step. And with more than 33,000 deaths from gun violence each year, it's a badly needed one.
A year from now, a new president is going to walk into the Oval Office—and they can either keep working to prevent gun violence in America or rip away the progress that President Obama has made. And it's not just gun violence prevention measures that are at stake—here are eight other things at risk of being ripped away if our next president is a Republican.
In the absence of congressional action, President Obama has used executive authority to tackle the urgent threat of climate change. He announced the first-ever limits on the amount of carbon pollution emitted from power plants. And his leadership made the the new international climate agreement in Paris possible. Not only would the United States' commitment to cutting emissions be at risk if a Republican climate denier gets elected president—but the entire agreement could fall apart without active U.S. leadership and participation.
When Congress failed to pass both the DREAM Act and a comprehensive immigration reform bill, President Obama took executive action to let DREAMers (undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children) and parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents remain in the United States. These executive actions, known as DACA and DAPA, would keep millions of families together—and every leading Republican presidential candidate wants to end them.
Nearly 5 million new American workers are set to receive overtime pay, thanks to new rules that guarantees overtime pay to most salaried workers earning less than an estimated $50,440. That's a significant increase from the previous salary threshold of $23,660—a salary that's below the poverty threshold for a family of four.
A historic nuclear deal will prevent Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon—yet many Republican candidates have boasted they'll tear it up a year into implementation. A Republican president would set us down the very path we've worked hard to avoid. Iran would be poised to get nearly everything it wants without giving up a thing: No restrictions on their nuclear program, no real warning if Tehran suddenly rushes toward building a bomb, and no more economic consequences—because the international economic sanctions would fall apart along with the nuclear deal.
Hillary understands that's not leadership—it's recklessness.
As millions of Americans can personally attest, student debt and the high cost of college are holding too many people back. That's why President Obama acted to help millions of borrowers with direct student loans from the federal government by allowing them to cap their monthly payments at 10 percent of their income. And the Department of Education is currently changing its regulations to make a ""pay as you earn"" plan broadly available within the next year—which would benefit millions more. We need to do more to help students and their families afford higher education—not undo these important steps while the cost of college skyrockets.
Marriage equality was a historic victory—but the fight for full equality for LGBT Americans isn't finished. President Obama has used executive authority to protect employment, housing, and health care for LGBT Americans—from adding gender identity to the federal anti-discrimination policy to prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in all federally funded housing programs. And if you think a Republican president would maintain this progress, remember this: Every Republican running for president opposed the Supreme Court decision affirming marriage equality.
President Obama used an executive order to establish diplomatic relations with Cuba, change travel policies, and provide more opportunity and training for Cuba's growing private sector. But most Republican candidates for president would go back to a failed policy of the past that limits Cuban Americans' ability to travel to Cuba and support their family and friends and blocks American businesses that could help free enterprise take root on Cuban soil—a strategic error for the United States and a tragedy for millions of Cubans.
President Obama has signed executive orders raising wages, strengthening equal pay laws, and requiring paid sick leave for federal contractors, which will give 300,000 American workers up to seven days of paid sick leave each year. Unlike the Republican candidates running for president, Hillary will defend these actions—because she believes that raising incomes is the economic challenge of our time.

Hillary Clinton sat down for a chat with well-known YouTube personalities for a heartfelt conversation about what it's like to be a woman running for president. Here's what we learned.
1. She shared how she spends time with her friends.
""I was with a group of my friends at a big event the other night, and we were dancing—and it was crazy.""
2. She believes our country needs a little more love and kindness.
""[I'm focused on] how we create a more welcoming and more supportive environment for a lot of Americans who I worry are anxious, insecure, fearful about their future.""
3.?Her mother is still one of the biggest influences in her life.
""My mother in first grade never had any food. So the first grade teacher saw she didn't have any food ... and said, ?You know, Dorothy, I brought too much food today. Would you like some?' ... That teacher did that every day, and my mother didn't realize until years later that that teacher was feeding her. And that made her feel that she needed to be of service and raise me to be of service.""
4. And she knows running for president isn't about her—it's about all of us.
""I will do my best to present what it is I want to do and how I want to help people. But I don't want me to be the focus of it, because in effect, being president shouldn't be about you, it should be about the country.""

Meet Fayde, an 8-year-old from Marion, Iowa.
He likes the things most 8-year-olds like: Star Wars, chocolate chip pancakes ... and campaigning for his favorite Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Fayde has been there for Hillary in some of her biggest campaign moments in Iowa. They first met at her Labor Day event in Cedar Rapids—and according to Fayde's mom, they became fast friends.
""I couldn't believe how my 7-year-old was acting with Hillary—swinging her arm, hanging on her. He doesn't do that with strangers. I was thinking, 'What are you thinking?! It's Hillary Clinton!'
""As we're walking away, I turn around—and there's Hillary and Fayde, laughing. She said, 'Are you ticklish?' and he said, 'Only in my armpits.' Then they were tickling. And he goes, with his tongue out:
""'Boo-yah.'
""I couldn't believe it.""
Fayde and his family drove across the state to attend the Jefferson-Jackson dinner in October, where he led the crowd in cheers.
When he gets new campaign literature in the mail, Fayde makes sure he's up to date on Hillary's plan to make college affordable. It's an important issue for him because his sister is headed to the University of Iowa this fall.
And when celebrities—like Scandal's Tony Goldwyn—come to Iowa to talk about Hillary, Fayde welcomes them and thanks them for their work.
He cheers Hillary on at every debate—and he knows that even if you're watching from your living room, you've got to wear your game day outfit.
When Hillary comes to town, he makes sure to attend—even if it means missing school.
And after the event, he always makes sure to tell her she did a great job.
But most important, Fayde knows that if Iowans stand together on February 1 at the caucus, they can make history."

Hillary Clinton and Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, have a lot in common: They're both pantsuit aficionados. They've both faced down hours of hostile congressional questioning. And they're both unwavering champions of women's rights—especially a woman's right to make her own health care decisions.
They recently sat down together with Refinery29 and talked about everything from ""mansplaining"" to the future of abortion rights and why Hillary is Planned Parenthood's presidential pick.
They bonded over the shared experience of testifying before Congress.
Cecile:""I took a lot of strength knowing that Secretary Clinton has been through this many, many, many times. She's an inspiration to me and women all across the world.""
Hillary: ""As [Cecile] rightly said, when you're standing up for what's right, it makes it somewhat less burdensome to face, in her case and later in my case, what was a stream of hostility. I took a lot away from her testimony.""
They took Republicans to task for attacking women's rights—and laid out the stakes in the next election.
Cecile: ""I do think what's important for your viewers to understand is what the U.S House of Representatives just did was pass a bill that basically said young women on Medicaid can't go to Planned Parenthood for basic preventive care. We're talking about breast cancer screenings, tests for sexually transmitted infections, getting your well woman visits. ... For many women we are the only doctor she will see this year.""
Hillary:?""This should not be viewed as politics as usual. [Republican presidential candidates] are serious. They are in many respects appealing to the most anti-woman aspects of their party and unfortunately getting a response.""
And they made one thing clear: When it comes to defending women's health, they'll never back down.
Cecile: ""There will never be a world without Planned Parenthood, because we will never go away. ... We will continue to serve people and to fight for their rights to reproductive health care that frankly determine their futures.""
Hillary: ""I want to be that president that will say, ?Forget about it. Don't waste your time; you know you're not getting past me.'""

As a longtime admirer of her both personally—her ability to achieve that ever elusive white whale known as work-life balance as both a politician and a mother—and professionally (her track record of taking a stand for women and children), I was determined to be useful in any way I could.
I imagined this might take the form of a cheeky straight-to-camera endorsement or maybe an amusing T-shirt design, but I never imagined I would be traveling to four or more cities a day to spread the word on why I vote, why you should too, and why I'm supporting Hillary Clinton's bid for the presidency. But when the lady asks, I answer, and I found myself heading to Boston with a massive, torn garment bag (shout-out to the dude at Chicago O'Hare airport who taped it up!) and a much-practiced speech in my shaking hands.
I want to start this recap the way I started the remarks I delivered in Boston; Manchester, New Hampshire; Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Chicago; Iowa City; and Des Moines, Iowa: by saying that involvement in politics came late for me. I didn't seize the opportunity to vote when I turned 18. Rather, I had to be urged to give a darn about the electoral process in our country.?
It was my friend Audrey Gelman, who worked on Hillary's 2008 campaign as a junior press aide, who told me point-blank in 2012 that if I didn't use my platform to talk about what mattered to me, then I was basically voting for Mitt Romney. And, especially as women, who we vote for matters just as much as the issues we rally around. I was never going to see the change I wanted to if I were half-hearted about showing up to the polls and half-hearted about saying what I believed in.
So it was only fitting that Audrey join me on this trip, often reminding me to reapply lipstick, pull up my tights, and carry my remarks in my purse. I thank her for encouraging me to pursue this incredibly gratifying aspect of my life.
A little more background: For those of you who don't know, I interviewed Secretary Clinton for the inaugural issue of Lenny Letter, and that opportunity, to speak with her for an hour about both the personal and the political, really informed the words I shared with the young people—mostly young women—who I met during this whirlwind 48 hours.
My first stop was Boston, where I had the opportunity to speak to a group of Hillary supporters—most notably Barbara Lee, a woman who has helped countless other women make their way to office. Her aim is to research the roadblocks that keep women out of office and also to get a diverse range of female senators, governors—and yes, presidents—elected, so the ratio of women to men in government can actually reflect our population.?
Barbara also has my heart for another reason: She collects modern art by women, including a piece by my mother (of a dancing little cake!) that hangs in her front hallway, and she has made generous donations from her collection to the Boston Institute of Contemporary Art.
Here I am prepping furiously before the event or, as they call it in politics, being briefed.
This event is where I linked up with Abby Wambach, the remarkable (and recently retired) U.S. women's soccer star. She has the potential to be a cult religious leader, that's how charismatic she is. Glad she's using her powers for good and stumping.
In New Hampshire I executed a quick outfit change, then zoned out on the nearest sofa. Abby caught this picture of me in a position that is very natural to me—reclining like a stressed snail.
After that, Abby and I parted ways: She continued through New Hampshire (miss you, Abby), and I stopped in Manchester before catching a plane to Chicago. The Chicago event was delightful, and not only because I met the mother and daughter behind the famous Eli's Cheesecake. They sent Audrey and me not one but FIVE cheesecakes.?
Here, Audrey is celebrating this historic win in our hotel room.
Iowa was next, starting in Iowa City, where I had lunch with a lovely woman named Sarah, who talked frankly with me about her range of concerns as a soon-to-be mother of two, a writer, a Creative Commons lawyer, and an Iowan. She also helped me wrap my head around the caucus process, which is complex, old-school, and really instills a unique sense of political responsibility in the Iowans I met.?
At the end of our journey, Audrey bought and presented me with the book Caucus Chaos, both a souvenir of our time and something I should read so that I can look incredibly smart at cocktail parties.
In Des Moines my event was at a very stylish, Portlandia-esque silkscreen and design studio, where I got a chance to meet Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards's daughter, Lily, the director of communications for the campaign in Iowa.?
I was really thrilled to be making the rounds directly after Planned Parenthood endorsed Hillary—their first primary endorsement in their hundred-year history. The adorable elves at the silkscreen studio made bags and T-shirts with this very personally pleasing image.
Before heading to the airport, I hugged Casey, the gentleman from the campaign who had been driving me in a minivan across the state. He loved my custom-knit Hillary sweater so much that I had no choice but to surrender it. I do feel it's in good hands.?
Doesn't he look pleased?
So ... what did I say to all these people? Why did I go to six cities, take five planes, give seven versions of this speech, and compromise my already shitty immune system??
It wasn't just for the cheesecake. Below is an abridged version of the remarks I shared. Although lots of these quotes have circulated in the media, it's always nice to give something context. Especially something as important as this ...
I'm not just here to tell you why you should vote, although you definitely have to vote, vote hard, and vote often. I also have an opinion on who you should vote for. I have admired Hillary Clinton for many years—24, to be exact, since I was six years old, and she entered the White House as the first lady of the United States. Even as a child, I was impressed not only by the poise with which she approached her position but also the ferocity. Not content to hide her own accomplishments and cede her identity to her husband, she used her time in the White House to help form the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women and to tell us that ""women's rights are human rights"" in her Beijing speech of 1995.?
Time and time again, she refused to be placed in the box that had previously been drawn for women in her position.
Secretary Clinton went on to have a political career that, on its own terms, is a radical accomplishment. As New York senator, she introduced the CARE Act twice, ensuring that rape and incest victims had access to emergency contraception in hospital emergency rooms. As secretary of state, she continued to battle against violence toward women, spearheading a U.N. resolution that established guidelines for an international response to sexual assault in war-torn areas.?
Through her travel, writing, and the Clinton Foundation, she has worked tirelessly for causes ranging from AIDS research to closing the word gap for low-income families and making reading a part of every child's life. Her conviction is moving; her tenacity, astounding.
It's no secret that women's rights matter to me. It's why my Twitter feed is littered with insanity and my underpants say feminist on the butt (NOTE: I packed several pairs of these. They make me feel good ... .)?
Women's rights matter to me more than anything in the world because, as HRC said, women's rights are human rights. Women's equality allows our children to grow up strong and protected, without fear. Women's equality is about the equality of every living human, inextricably linked with issues of racial injustice and religious persecution.?
We so often think globally when it comes to women's rights—as we should, as does Secretary Clinton—but the assault on our rights here in America is alarming, and becoming more so every day.
Hillary Clinton's commitment to reproductive justice, wage equality, and protecting working mothers is unparalleled. When we sat together this past September for an hour-long interview, I saw how clearly she understood the connection between women's rights and the Black Lives Matter movement and how committed she is to bringing young disenfranchised voters back into an active dialogue with politics.?
We discussed a range of other essential issues—student debt, universal health care, gun control, and campus assault, to name a few—and she impressed me time and again with her clear-eyed plans for tackling these murky and challenging issues, issues that so often feel powerfully divisive and impossible to surmount.
I can't talk about Hillary Clinton without saying that she has also survived horrific, gendered attacks on every aspect of her character with unimaginable aplomb. The way she has been treated by the media is just more evidence of the anger that exists toward women, particularly ambitious women, and the way we are not allowed to exist on our own merits but rather as extensions of men in power. Hillary Clinton has roundly rejected this premise, and she is running for president again. As a newly grown-up woman who has experienced my fair share of backlash, of public body shaming, of puritanical judgments, that moves me.
Nothing gets me angrier than when someone implies that I'm voting for Hillary Clinton simply because she's female, as if I have some feminist version of beer goggles—let's call it estrogen blindness. This assumption is condescending at best and hideously misogynistic at worst. The fact is, there are plenty of women whose politics horrify me, just as there are plenty of men who I would love to see in elected office. My gender doesn't prevent me from making cogent decisions about who to vote for: In fact, my gender only informs those decisions in a powerful way.
But I will end with this: We live in a country where women still battle daily for our basic rights. Whether it's wage equality, access to birth control, or the right to press charges against our rapists with a measure of support and dignity, women are having to run twice as fast as their male counterparts just to stay in one place. So while Hillary Clinton's anatomy is not the reason I'm voting for her, I believe that nothing will send a stronger message to America and the world at large than electing a competent, experienced, and brilliant woman to the highest office in the land.?
Our first female president would send a message that we are here. We are ready to lead. In fact, she has been leading all along."

The drinking water in Flint, Michigan, is poisonous.
For the last two years, the city of 99,000 has repeatedly experienced water crises. And recently, residents discovered that their water contains unsafe amounts of lead—900 times the EPA maximum.
In that time, the number of children suffering from lead poisoning in Flint—a city where 40 percent of people live at or below the poverty line, and 56 percent of the population is African American—has nearly doubled.
People all over the country are trying to figure out how this happened—and how we can make sure it never happens again.
When Hillary Clinton appeared on ""The Rachel Maddow Show,"" Rachel Maddow asked what she thought about the situation in Flint. Over the past week, members of Hillary's campaign staff have been in Flint, talking to officials about the problem.
""You sent some staff members to meet with the mayor of Flint. If you were president now, would you do something in terms of the response that isn't already being done?"" Rachel asked Hillary.
""I am just outraged by this,"" Hillary said.
""We need to test kids,"" Hillary said, ""provide quickly whatever health care they can get, whatever antidote is possible, and we need a fund for education. If these kids have been too exposed, the damage may be irreversible. We'll have to do more.""
The Justice Department is investigating this crisis in Flint. Hillary has said that the people of Flint deserve to know what Governor Snyder knew, and when he knew it. And she believes that officials at every level of government need to be held accountable for what happened.
Right now, Hillary is focused on helping the residents of Flint. She has called on the state of Michigan to pay for clean water until the city has access to safe drinking water again. She's also called on the governor to ask the Obama Administration to immediately set up a health monitoring and surveillance system, in order to test Flint residents, especially children, for lead poisoning.

The Republican candidates for president held their most recent debate in Charleston, South Carolina—a city hit by tragedy when nine Americans at a bible study were killed in a mass shooting last year.
But instead of debating how to close the loophole that let the Charleston shooter legally purchase a gun—or any other commonsense steps to prevent further gun violence—the candidates on stage spent their time assuring the gun lobby that they'll have nothing to worry about with a Republican in the White House.
1. When asked if we should keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals, Jeb Bush bragged about his support from the NRA.
The moderators asked Bush about the loophole that let the Charleston shooter buy a gun. His reply: ""We don't need to add new rules.""
2. Donald Trump doesn't think we should prevent anyone from having access to a gun—a convicted felon, a domestic abuser, or even a suspected terrorist.

3. Marco Rubio laid out his plan to undo President Obama's recent executive actions on gun violence prevention.

4. Chris Christie called President Obama a ""petulant child"" for trying to address the epidemic of gun violence.
Actually, Governor Christie, more than 90 percent of the American people support expanding background checks for gun purchases.
5. And Ted Cruz reminded everyone whose side he's on.
Cruz is proud to have stood in the way of commonsense gun reform. When President Obama and Senator Chuck Schumer fought back against the gun lobby, Cruz bragged that he ""led the opposition.""
All five of these Republican candidates managed to send one clear message: Not only will they not lift a finger to take on the deadly epidemic of gun violence in this country—but they'll stand on the side of the NRA.
We can't afford to send them to the White House. There's only one candidate in this race who's going to stand up to the gun lobby and take real action to to prevent gun violence in America—and that's Hillary Clinton.

During the fourth Democratic Debate, Hillary Clinton perfectly summed up why the Affordable Care Act is an amazing achievement—and why we can't afford to undo all of President Obama's hard work.
Hillary has spent her life fighting for universal health care—and she will continue to fight as president."
357,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5002,"January 18, 2016",Press Release - Let's Get One Thing Straight: Hillary Clinton Has Been Fighting For Progressive Issues Her Entire Career,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116721,Hillary Clinton,"She's a progressive who gets things done.
Want to know what it means to be a progressive who gets things done? Just look at what Hillary Clinton has done—and what she's fighting to do.
Health care has been the cause of Hillary's career.
As first lady of Arkansas, she worked to expand health care access to rural parts of the state. And as first lady of the United States, Hillary did something unprecedented: She helped lead the fight for health care reform—and when it didn't pass, she worked with Democrats and Republicans in Congress to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which currently provides 8 million low-income kids with health care. She kept fighting as a U.S. senator, securing health care for 9/11 first responders and expanding access to care for the National Guard, Reservists, and their families.
And she's not done. Hillary has a plan to make health care more affordable and get every American covered.
In 2010, Democrats finally achieved the health care reform they spent generations fighting for—and so far, 18 million Americans have gotten coverage, and millions more have received benefits like free preventive care and the promise that they'll never be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. We can't afford to tear it up and start over. That's why Hillary will defend the Affordable Care Act from Republicans who want to repeal or dismantle it (they've already tried 50 times). But she won't stop there—she also has a plan to lower out-of-pocket costs like co-pays and deductibles and make prescription drugs more affordable—and as president, she'll get it done.
Hillary has gotten one ""F"" in her life. It's from the NRA.
There's good reason for that: As senator, Hillary co-sponsored and voted for legislation to close the gun show loophole by requiring criminal background checks on all transactions taking place at events that sell firearms. Unlike Bernie Sanders, she voted against the dangerous immunity protections Congress provided gun dealers and manufacturers that prevent victims of gun violence from holding the gun industry accountable. And she co-sponsored and voted for legislation to extend and reinstate the assault weapons ban. Hillary has always stood up to the gun lobby—and that won't change as president.
Hillary has a plan to tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America—with or without Congress's help.
Hillary will fight to pass comprehensive background check legislation and to close the loopholes that help put guns in the wrong hands, including the gun show loophole and the loophole that let the Charleston shooter legally purchase a gun. She'll hold gun dealers and manufacturers accountable, repealing the gun industry's sweeping immunity from lawsuits. And she'll work to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, other violent criminals, and the severely mentally ill.
Hillary has spent decades fighting to put higher education within reach for more people.
Making college affordable isn't just a campaign promise for Hillary—she's been working on it since her days as first lady of Arkansas. She helped found the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund, which has helped more than 38,000 people attend college. Then, as a U.S. senator, she introduced legislation to give students the option of income-based loan repayment. She also introduced a bill to make Pell Grants available year-round, so nontraditional students could afford to pursue their education during the summer months. And she co-sponsored legislation to help student borrowers refinance their loans.
She has a plan to make college affordable for every student who wants to attend (and for those who already attended).
Under Hillary's plan, students would never have to borrow money to pay for tuition to attend a four-year public college in their state. And the 25 million Americans with student debt will be able to refinance their loans at current rates—which could save borrowers thousands of dollars each.
Hillary has consistently voted for comprehensive immigration reform.
Hillary supported comprehensive immigration reform legislation every time it came up for a vote during her time as a U.S. senator. She co-sponsored the DREAM Act three times. As president, Hillary will fix our broken immigration system—with or without help from Congress.
As president, Hillary will finish the fight to ensure a fair and just immigration system.
That starts with comprehensive immigration reform once and for all, with a path to full and equal citizenship that treats every person with dignity. But if Congress refuses to act, she'll defend President Obama's executive actions that provide relief from deportation for DREAMers and their parents, and she'll do everything possible under the law to protect immigrant families, including a system for parents of DREAMers and others who have contributed to this country to make their case and be eligible for deferred action.
Hillary has been a lifelong champion for women and families.
Hillary has been fighting for women and girls since she graduated from law school: Instead of taking a job at a big law firm, she went to work at the Children's Defense Fund as an advocate for women and families. As first lady, she advocated for the Family and Medical Leave Act and worked to increase funding for child care. And as a U.S. senator from New York, she championed the Paycheck Fairness Act, co-sponsored the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and fought for legislation to guarantee paid sick leave and paid parental leave for all federal employees.
It's time to recognize that equal pay, paid leave, and affordable child care are economic issues—not women's issues—once and for all.
That's why, at the Democratic debate in Charleston, South Carolina, Hillary said that closing the wage gap would be one of her earliest priorities as president. She'll also fight for paid family leave, because the United States is the only developed country in the world without guaranteed paid leave of any kind. And she'll make quality, affordable child care a reality for families across the country.

Hillary has taken on more than her share of uphill battles on behalf of American families. So it's no surprise that in Iowa, two billionaire hedge fund managers have launched an ad blitz against her because she's fighting to rein in the financial industry.
She's also taking on Big Pharma, who is attacking her plan to cap out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs and to crack down on spending taxpayer dollars on marketing instead of research. And she's taking on big corporations that move abroad on paper simply to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes.
But this isn't the first time Hillary has gone up against corporate lobbying groups. Hillary has been battling powerful special interests for decades—and she has the scars to prove it.
1993: As first lady, Hillary took on one of the toughest fights of her career: working to fix our broken health care system.
She was the driving force behind President Clinton's initiative to rein in health care costs and provide health care and financial security to American families.
Right off the bat, health insurance companies launched a barrage of attack ads, spending $50 million against the bill. And the health care and pharmaceutical industries together spent a total of $100 million against the bill.
Recognizing the threat to the status quo, a group called ""Citizens for a Sound Economy""—bankrolled by the Koch brothers—led a smear campaign against the effort. They even sponsored an advertising plane and a tow truck carting around a wrecked bus with a sign that read ""This is Clinton Health Care—Beware of the Phony Express.""
But Hillary refused to back down.
1997: Big Tobacco and the Koch brothers went after Hillary's plan to expand children's health insurance—and they failed.
After special interests blocked Hillary's health care reform effort, she worked with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to provide health care access to uninsured children.
But it didn't happen without a fight.
Despite the opposition, Hillary worked tirelessly to help create the hugely successful Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The program provides health insurance to 8 million kids and has helped cut the children's uninsured rate in half.
2005: Hillary stood up to the gun lobby and voted against immunity for gun manufacturers.
The NRA has never been a fan of Hillary. In 2002, they called her ""one of the most strident advocates"" of gun restrictions and later warned their members that they'd need a filibuster-proof Senate majority to get pro-gun legislation past ""the likes"" of senators like Hillary.
The gun lobby quickly discovered what the health care industry had known for a decade: Hillary isn't easily intimidated.
She supported the Brady Bill, and she voted against legislation that shields gun manufacturers and dealers from legal accountability when they endanger Americans—a bill the NRA called ""the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in 20 years.""
And the gun lobby has been attacking her ever since—but it hasn't stopped her fighting for commonsense gun laws. And Wayne LaPierre, CEO and executive vice president of the NRA, has taken notice.
2006: Hillary fought to allow Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices and make prescriptions more affordable.
Despite opposition from the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries—two of the most powerful lobbying forces in Washington—Hillary fought to allow Medicare to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices.
And she's still fighting to lower prescription drug costs today.
2007: Hillary called on Wall Street to take responsibility for the housing crisis.
As a senator for New York, Hillary went to the NASDAQ and criticized Wall Street for their part in creating the foreclosure crisis, and she called on them to put a moratorium on foreclosures.
Hillary has always fought for families—even when doing the right thing invited attacks from powerful, well-funded lobbies. And that's what she'll do as president.

Here's Why,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116787,Hillary Clinton,"""In a dogfight, I'd want Hillary Clinton on my side.""
The?Portsmouth Herald and Foster's Daily Democrat, two of New Hampshire's daily newspapers, just published a glowing joint endorsement of Hillary Clinton's candidacy for president, calling her ""by far the most qualified candidate seeking the Democratic nomination.""
Here are six of the reasons Hillary is their presidential pick.
1. She has the experience and leadership skills to be president.
""As president there would be no learning curve. She would be in full command of the geopolitical challenges facing our nation from day one. And given the concerns about global instability and terrorism we place a high value on this competence.""
2. She has the respect and admiration of Granite Staters.
""Granite State Democrats and independent voters, having seen and heard Clinton with their own eyes and ears, have rejected the decades of distortions peddled by her political opponents. We know the real Hillary Clinton, and we admire and respect her.""
3. She was a remarkable secretary of state.
""She is credited as the architect of the crippling sanctions against Iran that led to the recent nuclear deal. She brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. She was on the front lines of the tragedies and triumphs of the Arab Spring, learning hard and valuable lessons. Henry Kissinger, President Richard Nixon's secretary of state, said she ?ran the State Department in the most effective way that I've ever seen.'""
4. She knows how to find common ground to get things done.
""When Clinton saw a chance to improve relations with Burma, she approached then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell because she knew of his admiration for Aung San Suu Kyi, the nation's embattled human rights leader. Together, Clinton and McConnell made progress opening up this country that had been closed to the United States for decades.""
5. When she gets knocked down, she gets right back up.
""As first lady she led the White House's effort to implement health care reform, and she took a beating as vested interests pushed back against ?Hillarycare.' But Clinton proved resilient. The defeat taught her valuable lessons and she put that knowledge to work in her husband's second term, working with Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy and Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch to pass the Children's Health Insurance Program, which insured millions of previously uninsured children.""
6. She has a bold and detailed vision for the future of our country.
""But unlike her opponent, Clinton's plans are not all centrally planned and run by the government. They are collaborations: college students work to help pay for their education; energy companies have incentives to change for the good while a safety net is built for displaced coal-state workers. In the spirit of John F. Kennedy, government leads the nation toward big goals and taps the aspiration and ingenuity of individuals and the private sector. This is how America makes its greatest progress.""

On January 20, 2017, America will begin our next chapter. A new president will stand on the steps of the Capitol, raise one hand, and take the oath of office. From that moment on, he or she will decide whether we defend and build on the progress we've made under President Obama—or tear it all away.
That feels pretty personal to me—not just as an American who supports President Obama, but also as someone who was proud to work alongside him at the White House.
I remember vividly the day after the 2008 election when President-elect Obama asked me to come see him in Chicago. It turned out that he would ask me to be secretary of state. But first, we talked about everything he was doing to get ready for his first term—and everything he was learning about the reality of the economic crisis our country was facing. The president-elect was getting briefings every day, sometimes several times a day. And the news was not good. He turned to me and said, ""It is so much worse than they told us.""
He was right.
By the time President Obama was sworn into office, we were on the brink of another Great Depression. Before the worst was over, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 5 million Americans lost their homes, and 13 trillion dollars of family wealth was wiped away. Meanwhile, our auto industry—the pride of American manufacturing and ingenuity for decades—was on the verge of collapse. It turned out to be the second-worst financial crisis in our country's history.
President Obama changed all that. Look where we are today. We've had 70 straight months of private-sector job growth. Our businesses have created 14.1 million jobs. The unemployment rate is the lowest in seven years. And the auto industry just had its best year ever.
That's a pretty outstanding record for any president—let alone one who took office amid an economic disaster. ?That's not all. We've imposed the toughest regulations on Wall Street since the 1930s. We created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau just over a year ago—and it's already returned nearly $11 billion to consumers.
We've restored our standing around the world. Under President Obama's leadership, we worked with Congress and the United Nations to impose crippling sanctions against Iran, which paved the way for a landmark deal that will keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. We stood up for LGBT rights and women's rights around the world. We brought Osama bin Laden to justice. And thanks to a lot of painstaking diplomacy by the president and his team, nearly 200 countries have signed on to a landmark agreement to tackle the urgent threat of climate change.
Then there's the progress we've made toward a cause close to my heart: putting quality, affordable health care within reach for everyone. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 18 million Americans now have health coverage. Millions more are receiving benefits like free preventive care. Americans can sleep easier knowing they'll never be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Democrats have been trying to pass universal health care since Harry Truman's administration. President Obama got it done. Now we need to build on it, bring down out-of-pocket costs, and make sure every American can get the care they deserve.
If you take a step back and look at all America has achieved over the past eight years, it's remarkable to see how far we've come. But you'd never know it from listening to the Republicans. They're quick to demonize and demean President Obama. At the last GOP presidential debate, two candidates referred to him as a ""child."" That kind of racially coded rhetoric has no place in our politics. Instead of insulting our president, we should be thanking him. ?
Republicans aren't just harshly criticizing the president. They're threatening to undo just about everything he has achieved. They want to repeal the Affordable Care Act; in fact they've voted to repeal or dismantle it more than 50 times. They're hard at work dismantling workers' rights and voting rights. They want to take away women's rights to make our own health decisions. Some even want to reverse marriage equality—one of the greatest civil rights accomplishments in American history.
In short, they want to drag us backward and undo all the progress we've worked so hard to achieve. We can't let that happen.
As president, I will carry forward the Democratic record of achievement. I'll defend President Obama's accomplishments and build upon them. I'll work to get incomes rising for middle-class families, make college affordable, alleviate the crushing burden of student debt, protect LGBT Americans from discrimination, preserve women's access to health care and reproductive choice, and keep America safe from threats at home and abroad. And I'll never allow the Affordable Care Act to be repealed.
?We've made tremendous progress over the past eight years. That shouldn't be dismissed or taken lightly. Let's keep that progress going. Let's make sure no one turns the clock back. We've come too far. We've accomplished too much. We can do even more for our families, our communities, and the country we love. And together, we can build an economy and a country that works for everyone. That would be truly revolutionary.

Twenty-four years ago, Gail Be was going through a rough patch. So she met with a counselor in order to get some advice.?
"" In 1992 I was struggling with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. [Minnesota] had a program for people struggling with mental and physical disabilities. I could finish grad school or open a small business. ""
The counselor had seen Hillary Clinton wearing a red, white, and blue scarf on television that reminded her of Gail's necklace. So, knowing that Gail was a fan of Hillary's, she made a suggestion.
"" Why don't you bead something for Hillary Clinton?""
That sounded like a good idea to Gail.?She made Hillary a hand-beaded locket and sent it off, not expecting to hear back.?
Two weeks later—to Gail's surprise—she received a letter back from Hillary.
Gail was thrilled by the response—but more importantly, she was motivated. She received a $3,000 grant and started her own hand-made jewelry business.?
Today, Gail is a successful artist whose clients include celebrities (like Lady Gaga!). Recently, she made the world's largest beaded wedding dress—with over a million beads on it—and won a Guinness World Record!
When Gail heard that Hillary was running for president, she sent her a custom necklace as a thank you. And, just like the first time, Hillary responded.?
Hillary was so moved by Gail's story that she invited Gail to a campaign event in Minneapolis. Gail was thrilled to find out Hillary wanted to meet her in person.
"" As I waited in line for my turn, I saw that she was wearing a scarf around her neck. And when I turned the corner, to my great joy, she was wearing one of my necklaces! When I got close to her I said, in tears, ?Thank you for wearing my necklace!'""
People often ask Gail how she can create such beautiful jewelry. Her response is always the same: ""One bead at a time.""
"" It starts with a bead, that becomes a bracelet, that turns into a necklace, then into 990,000 necklaces. My one bead started with help of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is ... the best suited candidate to be the next president of the United States."""

Here's What We're Building Nationwide,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116850,Hillary Clinton,"Hi there. I'm Brad Komar. I live in a place that isn't Brooklyn, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, or Nevada, and I work for Hillary Clinton.
In fact, I'm all the way out in Colorado, getting the campaign ready for Super Tuesday—and I'm not the only one. There are staff like me in every single state that votes on March 1.
Now usually, we try to stay out of the news. This campaign is about you—and how Hillary has the best plans and experience to help the families we talk to every single day. But there was a story yesterday that seemed to imply that we hadn't already been laying groundwork beyond the four earliest states—and that's simply not true.
Working in every Super Tuesday state (and beyond)
We're a campaign, and we're here to win, so we obviously don't want to telegraph our game plan. Across the country, we've got more than 100,000 volunteers who have made more than 8 million voter contact attempts nationwide.
What we're building nationwide isn't about structure or process—it's about the people on the ground and the great work they do every day to elect Hillary Clinton as our 45th president. People like ...
Andrea Nemecek and Alfred Eze, who led numerous phone banks in Minneapolis?Saint Paul and Rochester, Minnesota, this past weekend. They got 100 volunteers who together made 8,000 calls and door knocks.
Kathleen Coffeen, an organizer in Tennessee who held three organizing meetings in the past two weeks with more than 50 people at each. Our Tennessee team has made thousands of calls on behalf of the campaign, and they've held eight surrogate events (and a couple with the boss herself!).
Our Oklahoma team, who have recurring phone banks running in Oklahoma City, hosted a huge debate watch party and a Tulsa organizing meeting tonight that has our largest RSVP list yet of any event in Oklahoma. In Tulsa!
I could keep going with a list of great stories from the field (it's practically endless), but suffice it to say: It's a shame to see some folks overlook the work we're putting in.
But that's OK. Like I said: This race isn't about us; it's about you. So we'll keep pounding the pavement, talking to you and your families about what keeps you up at night and how Hillary's fighting for you. Once the focus starts to shift from Iowa and Nevada and from our friends in the early states to the 11 states that will vote or caucus on March 1, we'll still be here. And hey—if you're in Colorado (or want to swing through): We're always looking for help.

Quick: Which 2016 presidential candidate:
called for tighter regulations on Wall Street before the financial crisis?
has unapologetically led the fight for universal health care in America since the '90s?
spoke out about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration, starting with the first speech of their campaign?
put forward a plan to close corporate loopholes that let companies ship jobs overseas?
called for an end to the Hyde Amendment (which makes it nearly impossible for low-income women to exercise their full reproductive rights)?
has stood up to insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry, the gun lobby, and Donald Trump?
If you guessed Hillary Clinton, you're right.
As first lady of Arkansas, first lady of the United States, a U.S. senator, secretary of state, and a presidential candidate, Hillary has not only supported progressive issues like civil rights, climate change, comprehensive immigration reform, reproductive rights, criminal justice reform, economic justice, and more—she's also put them front and center in the political debate.
Here's why these 54 leading progressives are supporting Hillary.
1. Uzo Aduba, actress
""This is someone whom I feel goes home and thinks about us. I feel like she thinks and considers what our challenges are. She cares about the things that are important to us.""
2. Jim Obergefell, plaintiff in the historic Supreme Court marriage equality case
""Too many people think that the fight for LGBT rights ended with marriage equality—but that's not true. ... That's why I endorsed Hillary Clinton. Not only does she understand how important the continued fight for equality is, but she has the experience, the knowledge, and the drive to get things done—and to make life safer and more equal for LGBT Americans.""
3. Jeanne Shaheen, senator
""I choose Hillary because I know her and I trust her.""
4. Howard Dean, former six-term governor of Vermont
""Hillary Clinton is by far the most qualified person in the United States to serve as president. ... She has enormous capacity to analyze and solve problems. She has a work ethic that drives her to persist until the job is done and done right. And she has a record in the Senate of successfully working with both sides of our very combative political spectrum in order to accomplish goals that improve the lives of ordinary Americans.""
5. Tammy Baldwin, senator
""When women get ahead, we all get ahead. It's like what she said in Beijing: Women's rights are human rights. And so it's not like women are in some little silo. We are part of the human family. And the progress of any part is progress for the whole.""
"" ... women need more than a vote or a supportive statement; we need a fighter in the White House ... ""
6. Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood
""More than ever, women need more than a vote or a supportive statement; we need a fighter in the White House who will put women and families at the front of the agenda. We face unprecedented attacks from candidates who seek to create a country where our daughters have fewer rights than we do now. As a senator, Hillary Clinton introduced eight separate bills to advance women's reproductive rights—eight more than anyone running. As secretary of state, she helped advance the status of women and girls around the world and confronted human rights abuses. And as a candidate she has put issues important to women on the front burner—like equal pay, overturning the Hyde Amendment, and ensuring patients can continue to come to Planned Parenthood. She has stood up for access to safe and legal abortion and will stand up to every attempt to roll back the rights generations have fought to earn. That's the kind of champion women deserve.""
7. Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign
""Hillary Clinton is the only candidate who, as a member of Congress and national leader, has consistently put the safety of the American public ahead of the interests of the corporate gun lobby.""
8. Karen Civil, author
""Recently, the debate over immigration, an issue that's very close to my heart, has been poisoned by some of the other people running. I am Haitian American. ... Watching the immigrant community be torn down over these past few months has been incredibly hurtful. But Hillary has been there every step of the way, making sure that everyone in this country is shown the respect they are owed.""
"" We should only support leaders that fight for commonsense gun reforms. Clinton passes that test.""
9. Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin
""In spending some time with her in person, I also found a mother and a grandmother who truly heard me and understood the depth of my loss. She knew all the statistics. But like so many, I've long since grown numb to the numbers. So instead, we talked about Trayvon and all the other families who have lost a loved one to gun violence. ... I agree with the president: We should only support leaders that fight for commonsense gun reforms. Clinton passes that test. Just as importantly, Clinton also wants to address larger, systemic problems.""
10. Jackie Ryan, first openly transgender elected official in Massachusetts
""I endorsed Hillary Clinton because her experience and her vision for the country speak to me. She's done so much for so many people: whether it's her work for the Children's Defense Fund, securing benefits for those affected by 9/11, or promoting human rights as secretary of state, she's always fighting. America needs a fighter.""
11. Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY's List
""Hillary Clinton is a lifelong champion for women and families and the most qualified candidate to be president. ... No one will work harder than Hillary. ... As president, Hillary will create more opportunities than ever for women and girls and for all hardworking Americans across the country, just as she has done throughout her exceptional career.""
12. Barbra Streisand, actress
""I want Hillary Clinton to be president. We need a woman president, we need compassion, we need to have a person who comes from the heart and brain. And experience, experience counts.""
"" She has the experience and right judgment to deliver results ...""
13. Eric Holder, former attorney general
""Our next president can't shy away from building on the progress of President Obama, which is why Hillary Clinton is the candidate that we need in the White House. She has the experience and right judgment to deliver results for families across the country. I've seen her deal with the issues that will confront the next president firsthand, and she has bold plans to address police brutality, fight for commonsense reforms to our gun laws, get incomes rising, and make college affordable. If we have a Republican president, they would tear down our progress on civil rights, health care, and curbing gun violence. It can't and won't happen under Hillary, who has spent her life taking on the toughest fights.""
14. Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL
"" ... we need more than an ally. We need a champion, and Hillary Clinton is that champion—for all of us. ... Secretary Clinton understands the connection between economic advancement and gender equality better than anyone else running.""
15. John Lewis, Congressman and civil rights icon
'I know her heart. We need her leadership, not just here in America, but all over the world. She is tireless in her advocacy for those who have been left out and left behind. She is ready to be president on day one. Hillary Clinton has my wholehearted endorsement, and I plan to work and campaign for her to see that she is elected the next president of the United States.""
16. Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters
""When it comes to fighting the climate crisis, the stakes couldn't be higher—and we are confident that Hillary Clinton is the right person for the job. With her proven history of leadership, strong environmental record, and a campaign committed to building a clean energy future, Hillary Clinton is without a doubt the most effective leader to stand up to Big Polluters and push forward an aggressive plan to tackle climate change and get it done.""
17. Amy Klobuchar, senator
""My home state is at the forefront of medical research and innovation. I know Hillary will fight hard for the critical investments our nation needs to find the treatments and cures that will help people stay healthy and ultimately, save lives.""
"" She will do big and important things.""
18. David Plouffe, 2008 campaign manager for Barack Obama
""She's the right person to protect President Obama's legacy on health care and so much else. The woman who helped create the CHIP program, which covers 8 million kids, won't stop until affordable health care is recognized as a basic human right in America. She'll enhance Social Security and strengthen Medicare. She'll continue President Obama's reforms to make sure Wall Street works for Main Street, not the other way around. She'll make sure America continues to lead the world in the 21st century. ... And, like President Obama before her, she will make history. ... Hillary Clinton will not just make an outstanding and worthy successor to President Obama. She will be a president we should all look back on and be proud we did whatever we could to make it so. She will do big and important things.""
19. Steve Benjamin, mayor of Columbia, South Carolina, and president of the African American Mayors Council
""Whether it's her vision for economic fairness and shared prosperity or her steadfast commitment to comprehensive criminal justice reform—it's clear that Hillary Clinton is the best candidate to be our next president.""
20. Gabby Giffords, former congresswoman and gun violence prevention advocate
""Talk is cheap. ... Only one candidate for president has the determination and toughness to stand up to the corporate gun lobby—and the record to prove it. That candidate is Hillary Clinton.""
"" I believe in her now.""
21. America Ferrera, actress
""I believed in her then, I believe in her now.""
22. Claire McCaskill, senator
""I can't imagine anyone who has run for president in my lifetime that has stronger qualifications to be President than Hillary Rodham Clinton. The majority of this country is going to want substance and stability over anger.""
23. Ricky Martin, performer
""Hillary has been a fighter for us for years, from supporting equal workplace legislation to working for equal rights for trans Americans. ... Growing up the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, I never dreamed that I would one day be a proud, out gay father of two beautiful little boys, in a country where marriage equality was the law of the land. Now, that's just an average day—that's what real progress is. Hillary knows this, and she's not going to stop fighting.""
24. Claudia Kennedy, retired lieutenant general
""With her experience and foresight, Hillary Clinton is uniquely qualified to defeat ISIS as our commander in chief. She's developed a comprehensive plan to address not only ISIS, but also the broader radical Jihadist movement that includes al Qaeda.""
25. Dolores Huerta, activist
""Hillary has been a lifelong advocate for children and families. She stands up for workers and immigrants.""
26. Star Jones, lawyer and television personality
""For me it's a very easy choice. She is at the forefront of issues that are important to me and other women of color, including pay equity, health care and reproductive rights, increasing the minimum wage, paid family leave, among other things.""
"" We cannot let hate and discrimination determine the outcome of this election. ""
27. Salma Hayek, actress
""Es incre?ble that the leading candidate of the Republican Party has been irresponsibly campaigning, using unfounded and insulting accusations against the Latino community to win votes. We cannot let hate and discrimination determine the outcome of this election. We owe it to the hardworking Latinos that came before us, to ourselves, and to our children, to show the people who unfairly label us as criminals and speak down to us that our community is strong, meaningful, and incredibly powerful. We are one of the largest, youngest, and fastest-growing groups in the United States of America. We deserve a candidate who respects the contributions we have made to this country and understands how important it is that our community continues to thrive, all while treating us con dignidad y respeto.""
28. Lena Dunham
""We live in a country where women still battle daily for our basic rights. Whether it's wage equality, access to birth control, or the right to press charges against our rapists with a measure of support and dignity, women are having to run twice as fast as their male counterparts just to stay in one place. So while Hillary Clinton's anatomy is not the reason I'm voting for her, I believe that nothing will send a stronger message to America and the world at large than electing a competent, experienced, and brilliant woman to the highest office in the land.""
29. Kathleen Turner, actress and chair of Planned Parenthood's Board of Advocates
""Planned Parenthood has issued its first-ever primary endorsement of Hillary because she's been fighting for women and families her entire life. In Arkansas, she launched the first rape crisis hotline in the state. In the Senate, she fought tirelessly for reproductive rights, access to birth control, and sex education. As secretary of state, women's health and women's rights were the centerpiece of her agenda. All that experience means that Hillary has the skills and the scars that no one else can match. She is the strongest, most qualified candidate for the office of president that I have ever encountered. But in an election, she'll only be as powerful as those who stand with her.""
"" She is a fighter; she's fighting for you.""
30. Tom Perez
""I'm a proud, progressive Democrat. ... She is a fighter; she's fighting for you. She's smart enough to get elected, smart enough and tough enough to govern effectively. And her North Star is the middle class, her North Star is working families, her North Star are those kitchen-table issues that keep people up across the country every night, fighting for good jobs, fighting for fair wages, fighting to make sure that women have an opportunity to succeed, fighting to make sure that everybody who works hard and plays by the rules can succeed. ... Hillary Clinton is a progressive who gets things done.""
31. Mara Keisling
""I'm so pleased that Hillary Clinton has outlined an ambitious and necessary LGBT agenda that would ensure transgender people are supported and protected in America. This year the epidemic of violence faced by transgender people has drastically worsened?particularly for transgender woman of color. Any person who wants to be president should be talking about such an important issue and putting forth bold proposals to secure full federal equality for all LGBT people, much like Hillary has done so comprehensively and thoughtfully today.
32. Roberta Kaplan, GMHC co-chair and counsel for Edie Windsor
""Hillary Clinton has proven once again that she really 'gets it.' From legal rights, to trans rights, to ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic, her plan comprehensively and creatively addresses every major issue facing the LGBTQ communities. The very fact that a leading candidate for president has issued this type of proposal is itself historic and a testament to how far we have come, as well as how much farther we still need to go.""
"" I don't think anybody is better prepared to be president than she is.""
33. Madeleine Albright, former secretary of state
'There are not a lot of people that have the brains that can deal with both domestic and foreign policy, and she can do that. I don't think anybody is better prepared to be president than she is.""
34. Kasim Reed, mayor of Atlanta
""Hillary Clinton has a heart for service and has spent her entire career working to expand opportunities for all Americans. As a champion for women's rights, thoughtful diplomacy, criminal justice reform, commonsense immigration policies and a clean energy economy, she has proven that she is the most capable candidate to lead our country. The City of Atlanta needs a partner like Hillary Clinton in the White House to continue supporting investments in infrastructure, transportation solutions, and expanding economic opportunities for working families.""
35. Olivia Wilde, actress
""The fact that she feels the plight of women and girls as the most important issue of the 21st century is a huge reason why I'm supporting her. ... I'm very excited to have not only a female candidate, but Hillary herself who has spoken so eloquently and passionately about the rights of women and girls around the world.""
36. Rini Sampath, University of Southern California student body president
""There's a lot at stake in this year's election: college affordability, women's reproductive rights, gun violence prevention, LGBT equality. The only person I can imagine protecting America's future and putting us on a path to progress is Hillary Clinton. I know she is the right candidate for us. I know she's the right candidate for a young person like me. I know she's the right candidate for Asian Americans like us, and immigrants coming from near and far.""
37. Hilda Solis, congresswoman
""Her commitment to promoting policies to develop alternative energy technologies and fighting global warming are only two of the many issues in which Hillary has shown her ability to lead. Senator Clinton also has a long record of working on issues that are important to women and to Latino families, such as education, healthcare and economic empowerment. I look forward to working to help elect Hillary the next president of the United States.""
"" Hillary will be a tremendous partner that delivers results. ""
38. Joe Riley, mayor of Charleston
""Our next president must rise to the challenges facing our cities and our country, and Hillary will be a tremendous partner that delivers results. Hillary is the president that our nation's mayors need to build and expand the progress of President Obama.""
39. Karen Weaver, mayor of Flint, Michigan
""She has actually been the only, the only candidate, whether we're talking Democratic or Republican, to reach out and talk with us about, ?What can I do? What kind of help do you need?""
40. Julian Castro
""Having watched and respected for years now Secretary Clinton, I know that she appeals to Americans of all backgrounds and colors, different perspectives and walks of life. ... The difference between [Hillary] and the Republicans is that she respects the Latino community.""
41. Wendy Davis, former senator
""What those of us know who've been around the Texas scene for a long time is that Hillary and Bill Clinton cut their teeth organizing communities in South Texas and creating the kinds of relationships that show they understand the real needs of people, not only in this state, but across these United States.""
42. Abby Wambach, soccer player
""I think all candidates have such valuable things that they're going after and that they want to change about this country. But I think Hillary lines up with my personal value system. ... I want to make sure whoever is in the White House stands for the things that I stand for.""
43. Mazie Hirono, senator
""Hillary Clinton has fought her entire life to create opportunity and prosperity for American families, small businesses, and individuals. Our country needs Hillary's tenacious leadership now more than ever.""
"" When asked why I, a longtime progressive activist who has worked closely with Bernie Sanders in the Congress, am so strongly supporting Hillary, my answer is simple.""
44. Jan Schakowsky, congresswoman
""When asked why I, a longtime progressive activist who has worked closely with Bernie Sanders in the Congress, am so strongly supporting Hillary, my answer is simple: I really, really want a pro-woman woman to be the most powerful person in the world.""
45. Luis Guti?rrez, congressman
""Hillary is with the Latino community, and I am with her. She will do what is best for Latinos and all Americans. Hillary is poised to propel the country forward, and I'm proud to be with her.""
46. Barbara Boxer, senator
""I want people to remember that Hillary was a U.S. senator from New York when they were hit hard by those planes crashing into the World Trade Center. And I still get chills thinking about Hillary. She went and stood on the rubble after 9/11 with a mask on. And she knew at that moment what the first responders were facing, health-wise. And she fought and fought to make sure we never forgot about those first responders. And I'll never forget that.""
47. Randi Weingarten, AFT president
""In vision, in experience, and in leadership, Hillary Clinton is the champion working families need in the White House.""
48. Katy Perry
""Ladies! There are so many incredible opportunities for us that are possible: equal pay, paid leave ... and your choice to have a family when and if it's right for you! These are just some of the reasons I am standing with her and will continue to do so. [This] election is one of the most important ones in decades, and the choices we make will have a profound impact on women for years to come.""
49. Mary Kay Henry, president of SEIU
""Hillary Clinton has proven she will fight, deliver, and win for working families. SEIU members and working families across America are part of a growing movement to build a better future for their families, and Hillary Clinton will support and stand with them. This movement for economic, racial, immigrant and social justice is poised to turn out to vote in November with their families and communities and keep pushing elected officials to deliver once in office.""
50. Carol Browner, chair of the League of Conservation Voters
""With a history of leadership on the international stage and a commitment to protecting public health, Hillary Clinton is the leader we need to meet the climate crisis head-on.""
51. Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the NEA
""Clinton is a strong leader who will do what is best for America's students. For more than four decades, Clinton has fought to make sure all children have a fair opportunity to succeed, regardless of their ZIP code. ... she understands the road to a stronger U.S. economy starts in America's public schools.""
"" And when she goes into the Oval Office, she will bring our hopes and our dreams with her. ""
52. Barbara Mikulski, senator
""We love Hillary, but why do we love Hillary? Well first of all, we know her. But most of all, she knows us. She knows our hopes and dreams, the needs and the people. She's been criss-crossing the country—having meetings, roundtables, and listening and listening and listening. She know that all bright leaders have to listen and learn from the people. And when she goes into the Oval Office, she will bring our hopes and our dreams with her. Hillary will be quite a fighter. She is already quite a fighter. We know her as a champion for the underdog. We know her as the champion for the little guy—and little gal.""
53. Chad Griffin, Human Rights Campaign
""We've heard the leading Republican presidential candidates repeatedly threaten to block our progress, and to revoke, repeal, and overturn the gains we've made during President Obama's two terms. While they fight to take us backwards, Hillary Clinton is fighting to advance LGBT equality across our nation and throughout the world. We are proud to endorse Hillary Clinton for president, and believe that she is the champion we can count on in November—and every day she occupies the Oval Office.""
54. Debbie Stabenow, senator
""I have seen Hillary fight from the first time I met her when we were on a panel together in Detroit. She was there talking about children and child abuse on behalf of the Children's Defense Fund. I was in awe. I said, ?Who is this woman?' Because she was so passionate and so articulate. I saw that same fight again when we came into the Senate together after the 2000 election. Whether it was equal pay, whether it was fighting to close loopholes to bring jobs home, whether it was lowering the cost of college, mental health, Hillary is someone you can count on to be there for you.""

There are many ways a gun can fall into the hands of a dangerous individual—and some of them are perfectly legal.
How much do you know about the loopholes in our gun laws?
In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed the Brady Bill, which requires licensed federal gun dealers to run a background check on anyone who attempts to purchase a gun. However, thanks to the NRA's lobbying efforts, the bill includes a loophole stating that if the FBI cannot process the background check within three days, the dealer can legally sell the gun to the buyer—regardless of the person's record.
The shooter who slaughtered nine people in a South Carolina church bought his weapon thanks to this so-called Charleston loophole.
Licensed gun dealers are required to conduct a background check before each gun purchase—but many private sellers are not. That means guns sold over the internet or at gun shows are rarely regulated.
According to the best data available, as much as 40 percent of annual gun sales occur without a background check because the sale occurs over the internet, at a gun show, or are person-to-person sales.
Federal law does not bar those the FBI suspects are terrorists from buying a weapon. The U.S. Senate recently had a chance to close this loophole—but Republicans, including three running for president, voted against the measure.
Even though federal law prohibits felons from purchasing or possessing guns, that prohibition does not apply to many convicted stalkers—because federal law does not prohibit people convicted of misdemeanor stalking offenses from buying guns.
"" This epidemic of gun violence knows no boundaries, knows no limits of any kind. And when this happens, people are quick to say that they offer their thoughts and prayers. That's not enough. How many people have to die before we actually act, before we come together as a nation?""-Hillary Clinton
Hillary has always stood up to the gun lobby—and as president, she'll work to close these outrageous loopholes while protecting the rights of responsible gun owners.

His last words were, ""I can't breathe.""
We repeated those words when we marched for justice for my son—justice we're still waiting on.?Along with too many others, Eric's death has forced our country to confront the effects of police brutality. We've got to do something about the violence in our communities—especially gun violence—and the racial and economic injustice that's connected to it.?
Hillary seems to be the only candidate right now who's talking about how we can be strategic in trying to solve this problem. That's why I'm endorsing her for president.
Most people remember my son's death, but I remember his life. I like to look back on Eric as a child at Christmastime—he was a lover of the Christmas season. One year, he and his brother wanted Big Wheels (you remember those cars? they were the thing), and when they saw them Christmas morning, their eyes lit up: ""Oh baby! Oh wow!"" Eric turned to his brother and said, ""Now I know we are rich.""
We weren't rich. We lived in public housing. But that day, it felt like we were. Eric was a joy to me, to his wife, and to his own children. It hurt so much to lose him.
I think all of us need to make the time to be involved in this election. With all the violence and injustice that's upon us today, we need a candidate who can move us forward—that's Hillary. We need to elect her, not just for us, but for our children, our grandchildren, and their children. We have to bring forth a legacy that will outlive us.
Stand up today and be a part of that.?

My constituents have been drinking, washing, and bathing in poisoned water.
Fifty-six percent of Flint residents are African American, and the majority of people in this city live below the poverty line. In March 2014, almost two years before I was elected, officials decided to get our water from the Flint River. But the Flint River eroded our lead pipes, and that lead seeped into our water.
In children, lead poisoning leads directly to learning disorders and developmental delay.
The number of children suffering from lead poisoning has doubled, and 10 people have died from Legionnaire's disease—most likely because of our poisoned water.
People deserve to know how this happened, and officials need to be held accountable.
Only one presidential candidate—Democrat or Republican—has reached out and asked, ""What can I do? How can I help?"" And that's Hillary Clinton.
Hillary is worried about the kids here. She saw the effects lead poisoning can have on children during her time as a senator from New York. It's ugly. She wants to help.
She rolled up her sleeves and got to work. Hillary sent campaign staff to Flint, and they came back and said, ""Here's what I see going on."" She talked about the issue on Rachel Maddow's show, calling on the governor to reach out to President Obama and to immediately set up a health monitoring and surveillance system.
And she closed the Democratic debate on Sunday by expressing her outrage, calling national attention to our struggle.
She's been doing her part to keep everything moving forward, so we can get help to the people who need it.
Hillary is the kind of friend you want in the White House. And in fact, she's the exact friend we need in the White House. Because this isn't something that's going to go away. We need a fighter.
We need someone there fighting for the city of Flint, making sure we're getting what we need. Hillary has shown us that's what kind of person she is—and what kind of president she'll be.
She gets results. And that's what we need.

So, what does Hillary think—is Planned Parenthood part of the establishment?

Wade's Last Anniversary,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116773,Hillary Clinton,"The right to safe and legal abortion is on the line—a Republican president would make sure of it.
When the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade on January 22, 1973, it recognized that the U.S. Constitution protects a woman's right to safe and legal abortion. It's a decision that has withstood 43 years of politically motivated attacks in the courts, in Congress, by state legislatures, and at the hands of violent extremists.
Thanks to Roe, more than four decades of women have had the right to make the most fundamental decisions about their lives, families, and futures. This is about women's health and women's rights—and the fight for reproductive rights is also a fight for economic opportunity.
Today, on the 43rd anniversary of the Court's decision, the future of reproductive rights in America is more vulnerable than ever before. And it's not an exaggeration to say that if we elect a Republican president to the White House, this could be one of the the last Roe v. Wade anniversaries we mark.
A Republican president would stack the Court with anti-choice justices
Over the past five years, states have enacted 288 abortion restrictions (and counting). That's more than the previous 15 years combined.
These restrictions—which keep abortion access out of reach for many women and even shutter clinics altogether—undermine women's fundamental rights and health.
Let's be very clear about one thing: The onslaught of attacks on these rights is not a coincidence; it's part of a deliberate strategy to chip away at the right to abortion altogether, until the Supreme Court has the chance to eviscerate the decision.
That may come sooner than you think: An abortion case the Court will hear later this year from Texas, Whole Women's Health v. Cole, is the biggest challenge to Roe we've seen in a generation—one that would be devastating to women in Texas and could significantly affect reproductive rights across the country.
This is what's at stake in the 2016 election. When the next president takes the oath of office next January, three of our current Supreme Court justices will be 80 or older—already older than the average justice retirement age. That means our next president could have the power to transform the Court, our laws, and our rights for generations to come.
Just imagine the damage a Republican president could do. Marco Rubio has said he will appoint justices that will overturn Roe v. Wade. Ted Cruz has referred to today as ""the dark anniversary of Roe v. Wade."" Ben Carson said he would ""love"" to see the decision overturned. All three of them would support a ban on abortion—even in cases of rape or incest.
We need a president who will appoint justices who will protect Roe. We need someone in the White House who will fight for women, who will build on the progress we've made over the past four decades—and who will keep going. We need Hillary Clinton.
This fight is far from over
Our reproductive rights are by no means ""established."" We fight for them every day. Women's health clinics, doctors, and advocates have been the targets of arson, shootings, and blockades for decades. And just last year:
And we still have laws on the books like the Hyde Amendment, which makes it harder for low-income women—and low-income women of color in particular—to exercise their full reproductive rights. Hillary will fight to repeal it as president. We need a leader who understands that a fight for reproductive rights is also a fight for economic opportunity.
Hillary has been fighting back against these attacks her entire career. As first lady, she led the U.S. delegation to the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, where she proclaimed that ""women's rights are human rights."" As senator from New York, she championed access to emergency contraception and introduced bills to strengthen a woman's right to make her own health care decisions. And as secretary of state, she made women's rights a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy.
On the 43rd anniversary of Roe, let's remember the fights we have waged and the hard work that lies ahead. Let's work to elect a leader that never takes the rights we have won for granted and has made protecting them a priority. Let's stand with Hillary. She stands with us—and she's been fighting alongside us on these issues for a long, long time.

"" She knows how to get things done in a country with many needs and many threats, the greatest of which is the political dysfunction that has prevented their being addressed.""Concord Monitor
She will reach across party lines to find common ground.
"" As a senator, she reached across party lines and joined forces with conservatives, including Sen. Lindsey Graham and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, to fight for job creation and universal health care.""Des Moines Register
"" There is also a strong chance, should Clinton become president, that the poisonous partisanship that's paralyzed Washington will be diminished rather than increased. Why? During her eight years as a senator from New York, she proved her ability to find common ground with Republicans, accords that allowed needed legislation to advance.""Concord Monitor
She's offering in-depth, concrete solutions for American families.
"" Clinton has demonstrated that she is a thoughtful, hardworking public servant who has earned the respect of leaders at home and abroad. She stands ready to take on the most demanding job in the world.""Des Moines Register

At 17, Patrick North has never cast a ballot or participated in a caucus before. But that didn't stop him from becoming one of the most dedicated volunteers for Hillary Clinton's campaign in Oskaloosa, Iowa—long before the Iowa caucus takes place on February 1.
Why work your heart out for a presidential candidate at such a young age?
""Because I strongly support her ideas,"" Patrick says. ""And it's the best I can do to make sure she gets in office.""
Political firsts
Patrick didn't followed politics until some older friends invited him to join a local young Democrats organization. That's where he learned one of the essential skills of campaigning: phone banking.
""The first time I picked up a phone at a phone bank was slightly terrifying,"" Patrick says. ""I remember that my hands were shaking a little bit. My voice was a little shaky too, but I asked that person how they were doing, and some questions about the caucus. And I made it through that phone call.""
Patrick has now talked to more than 150 Iowa caucus-goers on the phone and knocked on nearly as many doors in his community. At school, he tries to persuade his friends and classmates to get interested in the political process that kicks off right in their backyards. Many of his fellow classmates will be able to caucus this year: As long as you turn 18 before the general election on November 8, you're eligible to caucus in Iowa.
A candidate who's listening
""I like to keep my friends interested and informed,"" says Patrick. ""They know I'm involved in the campaign so they ask me about issues."" They've talked about gun violence prevention, equality, and—unsurprisingly for a group of high school students—college affordability.
Patrick wants to study biochemical engineering at Iowa State University after he graduates, and under Hillary's New College Compact, he'd be able to attend college without taking out loans to pay for his tuition. That's something he's very excited about—and thinks his peers should know about, too.
""She's going to be a good president because she has a plan to make sure that college is going to cost a lot less for younger people like me,"" he says. ""Hillary isn't ignoring young people, and she isn't ignoring Iowa. She's listening to us.""

As first lady of Arkansas, Hillary served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, spearheading an effort to train pediatricians to work in poor rural areas and make emergency care available to children across the state.
1983
When she was appointed to the Arkansas Education Standards Committee, Hillary crossed the state, investigating public schools, listening to parents and teachers, and working with a team of educators to create policy that would better prepare Arkansas students for a 21st-century economy.
1992
As first lady, she worked with Republicans and Democrats to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which now provides coverage to more than 8 million kids. And she helped pass the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which improved the foster care system and helped countless kids move from foster care to adoptive homes.
2000
As a U.S. senator, Hillary wrote legislation to recruit and retain high-quality educators, improve the safety of pediatric medication, and to promote quality education in developing countries.
And she's still fighting to give every child the chance to reach his or her full potential.
2015
Here's a recap of Hillary's decades-long fight for kids and families, in 60 seconds:

Here's an incredible sentence: A federal judge has ruled that a mandate requiring abortion providers in Louisiana to have admitting privileges at hospitals within 30 miles of their clinics is unconstitutional.
Fed Ct blocks Louisiana's TX-style clinic shutdown law that threatens to shutter all but 1 of 5 clinics in LA. @ReproRights #WeWontGoBack— Planned Parenthood (@PPact) January 27, 2016
Sound confusing? That's because it was written by people who didn't want you to understand it. But as someone who spent three years working for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, take it from me—this is a huge deal for women across the state.
To put it in simpler terms: Right now, the state of Louisiana has six licensed abortion providers. If this law had been upheld, that number would have dropped to two.
There are more than 4.5 million people living in Louisiana. This mandate, and similar restrictions in other states, make it incredibly difficult for women (especially low-income women and women of color) to exercise their reproductive rights—and can make doing so a costly, onerous thing to do.
I am thrilled that the court has protected abortion access—especially in a state where women's rights are constantly being threatened. But this fight is not over.
Laws like this are popping up all over the country, all with one purpose: to eliminate access to safe and legal abortion, or make a constitutional right a privilege only for those who can afford it. And this year, the Supreme Court will rule on the constitutionality of a similar law in my home state of Texas that amounts to the biggest challenge to Roe v. Wade in a generation.
That's one of the reasons I joined Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. At a time when we are in danger of losing our reproductive rights, women need a fighter in the White House.
I'll take on Republicans or anyone who tries to interfere with women's health. Proud to have @PPact's support in this important election. -H— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 7, 2016
We need someone who will not only stand up to attacks in Louisiana and across the country, but actually advance reproductive rights.?Proudly stand with Planned Parenthood. Fight to bring this country into the 21st century with equal pay and paid leave. Get rid of laws like the Hyde Amendment once and for all, and call out restrictions that disproportionately harm low-income women and women of color. In short: We need a president who gets it, and who is in this fight alongside us.
Every woman has the right to safe and legal abortion. Louisiana lawmakers may have forgotten that—but thankfully, a federal judge didn't.

Three days after announcing she was running for president, Hillary Clinton met a young man named Bryce Smith who owns a bowling alley in Adel, Iowa.
He told her a story that stuck with her:
The bowling alley has been a community gathering place in Adel since 1957. Bryce worked there part time for years before he had the opportunity to purchase it as a fresh college graduate of the University of Northern Iowa. And although Bryce is thrilled to be a new small-business owner—doing something he loves—he also has nearly $40,000 of student debt to repay. In fact, his student loans are his biggest business expense.
BRYCE: New college graduates, they may not want to go to big corporations for 10, 15, 20 years before they start their business. A lot of us have ... fresh ideas that we want to do now, and we have the motivation, too. ... So that's my biggest thing, is the barrier of entry and financing.
HILLARY: This is a really important point. We all know about the student loan debt, but I've never heard anyone so persuasively link it to the slowdown in business startups. ... we've got to tackle this student debt problem. ... You've given me an insight that nobody else has.
As promised, Hillary came to Bryce's bowling alley in Adel to talk about what we can do to help young people achieve their dreams—and that includes making college more affordable and helping people pay off their student loan debt.
""Bryce's story is so touching,"" Hillary said. ""This is the community where he grew up, this is where he worked as a young man, high school and college, and he cared so much about what this business provided to Adel. ... He was describing his dream of someday owning it and then getting his chance to try to do that and what he wanted to build because of it. That is the American Dream.""
""That's the basic bargain of America: You work hard, you do your part, you can get ahead and stay ahead. But we're making it awfully hard today—and particularly for young people—because what's happened is, so many young people are ... not getting on those first rungs of the opportunity ladder, and it's made doubly hard if they are burdened by student debt.""
Hillary will fight to make sure every young person has the chance to follow his or her dreams. Learn more about Hillary's plan to make college affordable.

The Iowa caucus is around the corner, and the polls are neck and neck.?
Volunteers are doing everything they can to bring the caucus home for Hillary: knocking on doors, making phone calls, and having neighbor-to-neighbor conversations.?
Here's how your $5 donation supports those volunteers—and gets us one step closer to securing Hillary's first victory.?
$5 can buy postage to turn out 10 caucus-goers
Since the beginning of the campaign, volunteers in Iowa have been asking people to sign ?commit to caucus? cards. We're getting ready to mail those cards back to them to remind them to show up on February 1. That could mean the difference between winning and losing in key precincts!
$5 can help contact 100 people?
One of the most effective ways to reach people on Caucus Day is on their phones. The campaign will be sending out text messages to remind people when and where to caucus. Texts can cost up to 5 cents to send—so your donation can pay for 100 text messages.
$5 can buy a walk packet?
Ever seen a volunteer walking around with a clipboard and a pile of papers? Those papers are called a ?walk packet,? and they include maps, directions, and caucus FAQs to help volunteers know where to go and what to do when knocking on doors and having conversations with voters.
$5 can buy paper, ink, pens, envelopes, and labels.

When Iowa holds the nation's first caucus in less than a week, Jim and Karen Gorham will be there—just as they've been to every single caucus since 1972.?
This year, they'll be caucusing for Hillary Clinton.
The Gorhams live in Washington, Iowa—halfway, as they like to say, between Washington D.C. and Washington State.
""One of the things that's been really good about our 55 years together is that our ideas have grown together,"" Karen says.
For Jim and Karen, politics have been close to home from the start.
The first time they caucused together, they volunteered to run their neighborhood location. Since Washington is such a small town, they decided their home was as good a place as any.
They're proudly doing everything they can to pass this family tradition down to the next generation.
Karen and Jim remember when they first realized caucusing was having an effect on their children.
""When our son was 5, maybe 6, at school they were required to make a banner for the caucuses. So he made his banner with McGovern, and everybody else made theirs with Nixon. He came home and told us that story, and we thought, ?Hmm, at that young age they're picking up things already.'""
This year, there's a lot on the line.
And the Gorhams are ready to do their part to help elect Hillary Clinton—and keep the Republicans out of the White House.
""We've never had a chance,"" they say, ""since we started voting in 1960, to vote for somebody that has the issues that are closest to us in her heart. We have four granddaughters and two daughters. That's as personal as you can get for us. Hillary Clinton focuses on things that will make a huge difference in our daughters' lives.""
Watch Karen and Jim's story:
Text IOWA to 47246 if you'll be joining the Gorhams and caucusing for Hillary on February 1."

Together we can fulfill its promise.
When I became an overnight shift manager at the Goodyear plant in 1979, there weren't many women on the job (and the few there were didn't stay long). But I worked my way up, and in 1996, I even received the plant's ""top performance award.""
It wasn't until 19 years after I'd started that I learned I was being paid less than my male colleagues.
One evening, I came into work early, checked my mail, and there it was: an anonymous note that listed my salary and the salaries of three men with the same title. I was being paid significantly less for the same job—less than I deserved and less than my family needed.
The easiest thing to do would have been to let it go. But that's not who I am.
I took my case all the way to the Supreme Court. But they ruled that, though I had clearly been discriminated against, I had filed my case too late to be compensated.
Luckily, we live in a country where, when the laws are wrong, we can do something about it.
Seven years ago today, President Obama signed his first bill into law: the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which makes it easier to challenge wage discrimination in court. It was an important step toward equal pay for women, and an important victory for the increasing number of American households where women are the primary breadwinner. Under this law, no one else will ever have to accept the gender discrimination I faced without the chance to challenge it in court.
But this isn't just my story. It's the story of women working full time across this country who, despite new protections, are on average still earning just 78 cents for every dollar a man earns—with women of color often being shortchanged even more. That's money their families are losing out on.
Our next president can either build on the progress we've made and go even further—or dismiss this important issue. Women across this country need more than rhetoric; they need action—they need a fighter in the White House.
I firmly believe Hillary Clinton will be that fighter.
Hillary has spent decades fighting to advance women's rights and economic opportunities. We fought side by side to pass the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which she co-sponsored in the United States Senate, and she has been a tireless champion for the Paycheck Fairness Act—legislation that would go even further to address the pay gap. And she's put issues like equal pay, affordable child care, paid leave, and reproductive rights front and center in her campaign.
Hillary understands that these issues can't be dismissed or pushed to the sidelines. They're not just ""social issues""—they're fundamental to our country's economic future, and they are at the heart of everything she's fighting for on this campaign. For Hillary, this is about more than politics—it's personal. She just gets it, plain and simple.
Of all the candidates in this race, she is the one we can count on to be a fierce and uncompromising champion for women, for basic fairness, and for opportunity for everyone. She's not just a steadfast supporter of issues that affect women's lives; she's someone who has been there. She doesn't just say the right things; she does the right things. And when it comes to finally closing the gender pay gap once and for all, that will make a world of difference.

Ellen Mayberry has been taking a drug that helps her cope with crippling migraines for more than 30 years. Over the past decade, the retail price of that drug has increased—not just a little bit, but by thousands of dollars.
When Hillary Clinton came to Iowa, Ellen saw a chance to share her story with someone who might actually be able to help. She handed Hillary a letter before her speech and hoped that Hillary would have a chance to read it at some point.
To Ellen's surprise, Hillary began reading the letter right then and there.?
After reading Ellen's letter, Hilary was shocked—and angry. So she got up on stage and read Ellen's letter to the crowd and explained what she was going to do about it.
This isn't Hillary's first time going toe-to-toe with pharmaceutical companies. She took them on in the 1990s during the fight for health care reform, and she has called out price-gouging CEOs on the campaign trail. As president, she'll do more to bring down out-of-pocket health care costs—and stand up to anyone who tries to stand in the way of hardworking Americans and the care they need.

Here Are the Things I'll Never Forget,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116940,Hillary Clinton,"What I heard in those early days—and every day since—has stuck with me.
Back in April, I began my journey as a presidential candidate with a visit to Iowa. Today—nearly 10 months and 160,000 miles of travel later—our campaign has come full circle: America's first voters are about to begin electing our next president. From the very beginning, I wanted this campaign to be a little different. So instead of kicking things off with a big speech, we headed out to talk directly with people—in coffee shops, at churches, in backyards, at community colleges, and yes, at a Chipotle in Maumee, Ohio.
From our very first trip to Iowa of this campaign—listening to Bryce Smith talk about his bowling alley and his student loans. I recently made good on my promise to come visit!
What I heard in those early days—and every day since—has stuck with me. People have shared their hopes and their worries. But even as they talked about the challenges their families, businesses, schools, and communities are facing, there was a sense of positive possibility.
A memorable moment at Rancho High School in Nevada: sitting down with a group of young people who are DREAMers in more than name alone.
Those conversations have informed me and helped shape this campaign. They've made me a better candidate. And I believe that, thanks to everyone I've met, I will be a better president—someone who truly understands what we need to do to give our kids and grandkids a better future.
Kiki's Chicken and Waffles in Columbia, South Carolina. Kiki had a hard time getting her business up and running, but she stuck it out—and today, it's thriving.
When I started running for president, I didn't know that some of the issues I've been talking about would end up front and center in my campaign. I knew I'd present my vision for where our economy should be in the 21st century. I knew we'd talk about national security, about how we can build on and improve the Affordable Care Act, and about my proposals to support small businesses, raise wages, and create good-paying jobs.
At the VFW Historic Post 9211 in Reno, Nevada.
Then there were the issues that simply came up again and again—like substance abuse, the rising cost of prescription drugs, and the struggle to care for loved ones who are aging or have disabilities.
And of course, some topics have come into even sharper focus over the past few months: the threat of global terror, the need to take action on gun violence, attacks on reproductive health and rights, the epidemic of violence facing the transgender community, the need to take on systemic racism and stand up to bullies, the crisis in Flint. Everywhere I've been, I've learned more about the concerns that keep families up at night—and what we need to do to solve them.
A moment of reflection and community with faith leaders at Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church in Philadelphia.
On my very first trip to New Hampshire, the subject of addiction came up—and it kept coming up, wherever I went. I met a grandmother who is raising her grandchild, because her own daughter is struggling with substance abuse and can't be the parent she should be. I've listened to moms and dads who have lost their children to addiction, and I've heard from doctors and counselors who are doing everything they can to save lives. As one woman told me at a discussion in Keene, ""We're not bad people trying to get good; we're sick people that deserve to get well."" Those words have stuck with me.
I've heard from people who work full time as caregivers but struggle to afford care for their own children and parents. A woman named Lulu told me that she has spent 42 years doing this backbreaking work, and people constantly ask why she doesn't just quit. She says she wouldn't dream of it—she cares too much for her clients, some of whom live alone and have no other help or companionship.
Caregivers from around the country shared their stories at a roundtable in Los Angeles.
Keith in New Hampshire told me about his 84-year-old mother who has Alzheimer's. She can't be left alone, and he can't afford adult day care for her—so he brings her to work with him every day.
And on one heartbreaking day in Chicago, I sat down with a group of mothers who belong to a club that no parent ever wants to join: All have suffered the loss of a child to gun violence, some at the hands of police, others at the hands of gangs, random shootings, or other senseless violence that stalks too many of our young men and women. As they handed me pictures of their beloved children, they talked about turning their grief into national action that could spare other families the pain they've endured. After I left, I learned that as we spoke, a 9-year-old boy was shot and killed just miles away.
I met a woman in Iowa named Bethany, a single mother of three. She is determined to create a better life for her family, and so she's juggling a job, raising her kids, and finishing a degree at the local community college. She doesn't expect anything to come easy, but she did ask me what we could do so that things wouldn't be so hard.
The answer is, there's a lot we can do—if we work together. I've said many times that I'm running for president to deal with the big problems, but also the problems that often go overlooked in politics. That's why, in addition to a broad economic plan to raise incomes for middle-class Americans, I've introduced specific proposals for creating debt-free public college tuition, preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, supporting families affected by autism, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and curbing the substance abuse epidemic.
Texas has been a special place for me ever since I registered voters in San Antonio and the Rio Grande Valley. It was fitting to return to the community, and it was such a warm welcome.
The past 10 months have been inspiring and eye opening, to say the least. We have had rallies with thousands of voters and quiet moments of reflection. I've laid out my plans on the debate stage and answered more than 500 questions at town halls.

I wanted to be able to help her.""
Marquis Boston wasn't sure what to put in the ""occupation"" field on his donation form. He was hired as a janitor at the hotel where he worked in Little Rock, Arkansas, but he always tried to help out wherever he was needed—at the front desk, taking items up to guest rooms, or filling in for someone so they could take a break. He didn't want get it wrong, though. So he entered ""janitor.""
Then he clicked submit, donating $1,000 to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.
Boston had been saving up for months. Instead of going to the barber every week, he started going every other week. He cut junk food from his grocery list, walked instead of driving whenever he could, and learned how to change his own oil.
""It was easy for me to do,"" Boston says, ""because I knew donating to the campaign would mean so much to so many people. It would give Secretary Clinton a chance to change millions of lives. That's more important to me than those little things were.""
Boston first became a fan of Hillary in the early ?90s, when she pushed for universal health care. He remembers being impressed by how much she cared about the well-being of other people.
""She was the president's wife. She had health care, her daughter had health care. They weren't going to benefit from this. But the way she fought, it was like her own life was on the line, and the fact that she was willing to go so far in order to improve the lives of regular people really got to me.""
He continued to follow Hillary's career through the United States Senate and her first presidential run in 2008. He remembers admiring the way she urged her supporters to rally behind then-Senator Barack Obama, and later accepted a position in his presidential cabinet.
""The president asked her to take one of the hardest jobs in the country, and she took it, because she knew that she could help millions of people in that job. It was inspiring to watch.""
It was then that Boston decided he would do everything could to support Hillary if she were to run again.
Word of his large donation spread quickly—and eventually, the story made its way to Hillary for America headquarters in Brooklyn. Before long, Boston got a letter inviting him to attend a dinner Hillary was hosting in Little Rock.
He was in shock—and remained in shock all the way up until the actual dinner, when he finally found himself face to face with the woman he'd admired for more than three decades.
""I couldn't feel anything, I was so overwhelmed. I remember pinching myself—actually, physically pinching myself—to make sure it was real, and still not being 100 percent sure until my skin turned red.""
Now, Boston is urging others to support Hillary's candidacy.
""I know that not everybody can give money, and I don't want people to get fixated on the amount I donated. We all have bills, you know? But even though not everyone can donate, we can all support the campaign by registering to vote, and making sure that we hit the polls when the time comes. That's more important than anything.""
Today is the last fundraising deadline before the first people in the country make their decision in this election. Chip in what you can afford to help Hillary win in Iowa.

The New York Times just joined the growing list of newspapers backing Hillary Clinton for president. Here's why she's the Democratic presidential pick of the national paper of record:
She's a policy expert—and she's offering smart, in-depth solutions to America's challenges.
"" It's not just that she's done her homework—Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you'd care to name.""
She's spent her life fighting to make life better for working Americans.
"" Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.""
She was a phenomenal secretary of state.
"" She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table.""
She isn't afraid to stand her ground—but she knows how to build consensus to get things done.
"" Mrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change.""
The Times isn't the only paper to enthusiastically back Hillary.
She's also earned the endorsement of the Boston Globe.?
"" The best reason to support Clinton isn't the weaknesses of her opponents; it's her demonstrated strengths and experience.""
And Iowa's Des Moines Register, Iowa Starting Line, and Iowa Press-Citizen:
"" True inspiration doesn't come in chanting slogans, waving signs or enjoying a candidate's soaring speech. Real inspiration happens in the real lives we change through progress born out of grueling, hard-won fights.""Iowa Starting Line
And in New Hampshire, she has the support of the Concord Monitor, Portsmouth Herald and Foster's Daily Democrat, and the Keene Sentinel:
"" No contender's resume can come within miles of matching Clinton's. She's ready to take up the nation's top job on day one and her knowledge of domestic issues and foreign policy is encyclopedic.""Concord Monitor"

I've worked on a lot of campaigns. And I can tell you from experience—from exhilarating wins to heartbreaking losses—that there is one thing that gets people to the polls and decides the outcome of elections on the ground:
Asking your friends, family, and neighbors to go out and vote.
Most of you probably don't live in Iowa—I don't either. But I bet you know someone who does. And if you want to make sure Hillary Clinton wins the Iowa caucus on February 1 and heads to New Hampshire with as much momentum as possible, please believe that the most important thing you can do right now to help Hillary on Monday night is post a message on Facebook and tag your friends in Iowa. (Here's how to find your Iowa friends on Facebook—and even if you truly truly don't know anyone in Iowa, write a post anyway!)
It really is that easy. And I'm going to make this even easier for you.
Here's what I'm posting on Facebook—and what a co-worker of mine is posting as well. Write your own or use ours as inspiration!

President Bill Clinton took over Hillary's Snapchat yesterday and shared a behind-the-scenes look at the excitement on the ground in the final days before the Iowa caucus—as only he can.
For the first event of the day, President Clinton set off for Fairfield, Iowa.
In Fairfield, he rallied a huge crowd with stories from when he first met Hillary.
Shaking hands with everyone can be slow going.
On the way out of Fairfield, President Clinton stopped for coffee ...
... and then made his way to Muscatine.
And kept making his way to Muscatine ...
... for quite some time.
With so much free time in the car, President Clinton decided to share some of his favorite facts about Hillary.



The long drive was worth it: The crowd in Muscatine was very excited to see him.
Shaking hands after the speech, President Clinton saw a young woman holding a saxophone and had to get a picture with her.
Then he headed to Davenport to reunite with Hillary.
Backstage, he watched as Hillary told an excited crowd about her vision for America.
""She is the best change-maker I have ever known,"" he said in his last rally of the day. ""And with your help and your caucus voices, you can make her the next president of the United States.""
After Hillary was done giving her speech, President Clinton sent his last ""snap"" of the day.

President Bill Clinton has been by Hillary's side since law school—and as he puts it, she's the ""single best changemaker"" he's ever known. At a recent campaign stop, he shared a few lesser-known stories about Hillary's ability to make things happen.
Example one: better schools for Arkansas
When he was governor of Arkansas, he put Hillary in charge of coming up with new state educational standards. She traveled to every county in the state to talk to parents and teachers, and she came up with a plan to improve the public schools:
And her hard work paid off for the students of Arkansas; the state became one of the most improved school systems in the nation.
Example two: juvenile prison reform
As one of her first jobs out of law school, Hillary went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. She traveled to prisons in South Carolina to investigate why African American teenagers were being jailed as adults—and her work helped to change federal law.
Example three: expanding early childhood education
When he became governor, a lot of poor and rural Arkansas counties didn't have preschool or kindergarten, meaning many kids weren't getting off to the strongest possible start. Hillary made it her mission to change that. She came home one day and told him:
The program was called HIPPY (Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters), and Hillary was determined to bring it to Arkansas children.
Hillary got the program started in Arkansas, and soon it became a model for states across the country.
The story is a classic example of Hillary's determination and ability to make change happen. And President Clinton has plenty more examples where that came from.

Watch President Clinton tell all three stories about Hillary:
She is the best qualified person for this moment in history I have ever seen. And I have studied all my predecessors.
The average person who gets elected president is intelligent, hardworking, and honestly tries to do what they say they're gonna do when they get there, but there's a big difference in a who can do and who can't.
Here's what I know about Hillary. She's the single best changemaker I've ever met in my life, and we need a changemaker, not a change talker a changemaker.
So I'll tell you a couple of stories you may not know. A court said our schools weren't properly financed in Arkansas, and we we're going to have to reallocate the money. I put Hillary in charge of coming up with new standards; she went to every county in the state, made all the people who didn't want to change mad, presented it to the legislature. The crusty old head of the education committee in the legislature said it was so good that maybe we had elected the wrong member of our family. There's something to be said for that. Anyway.
Nine years later I come to Iowa, running for president telling you, one reason you ought to vote for me is that the same guy had just given us a report saying the two most improved school systems in America were in Arkansas and South Carolina. She did that, not me. She had never been elected to anything; she just always made something good happen.
She went to South Carolina to see why all these African American teenagers were being jailed as adults; 13, 14, 15 years old being kept for years in adult prisons. And she went back and they changed that too. She hadn't been elected to anything but she was making change. That's just the beginning I could keep you here until tomorrow morning telling you these stories.
It's hard work. It's policy. The country needs somebody who can actually get something done.
She comes in one day just jumping up and down happy. She said, ""You know, I've been so worried we have six of the 20 poorest counties in America."" She said, ""These kids are going to school, they're not able to learn. There's no kindergarten, there's certainly no pre-kindergarten and there's no preschool. I found it. I found a preschool program in Israel that teaches people to be their children's first teachers even if they're illiterate. I think it would work here."" I said, ""Well, what are we gonna do?"" She said, ""I did it. I called the woman who started it, she'll be here in 10 days and we're gonna start this program."" Now ...
Here's what happened. Next thing I know I'm going to these little graduations for preschoolers. Next thing you know it's in 26 states, it's still thriving. And there are thousands of people in this country today who have learned more and grew up just because of her. And they have no clue, and she didn't care, and she hadn't been elected to anything. She just made something good happen.
You're entitled to give all these remarks the love discount if you want. But everything I have told you I believe with all my heart. She's the best person to win the election, the best person to implement the changes we need, economically and socially, the best person to preserve the gains we've made under President Obama. But mostly, I want you to do what's best for you. Most of the people in this audience have more tomorrows than yesterdays.
Those of us who have more yesterdays than tomorrows, believe it or not, spend most of our time thinking about the future. And I believe it would be a gift that would keep on giving, because she made everything she ever touched better. Thank you very much.

... and stopped to recognize a unique moment.
"" It is rare that we have the opportunity we have now to have a real contest of ideas. To really think hard about what the Democratic Party stands for, and what we want the future of our country to look like—if we do our part to build it.""

Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly know a little something about grit, courage, and hard work.
After surviving a near-fatal shooting while at an event in her district, former Congresswoman Giffords began the long road to recovery. With the support of her husband Mark Kelly, a former astronaut, getting better became her life's work.
And so did taking on one of the largest, best-funded special interests in Washington.
Gabby and Mark have made it their mission to stand up to the gun lobby and bring together Americans who support commonsense gun reforms. And right now, they're logging hours (and miles) on the campaign trail, helping to elect Hillary Clinton—the only candidate in this election who has the courage and commitment to confront the epidemic of gun violence in America and deliver real solutions.
Between stops, Gabby and Mark answered a few questions about standing up to the gun lobby, supporting each other, and what makes them hopeful.
Gabby, you've often said that you still have trouble speaking, and it can't be easy to be out on the campaign trail. Why was it so important to you to get out and talk to voters in person on Hillary's behalf?
GG: Like I said in Iowa with Hillary and Mark, speaking is hard for me. Getting on stage to give a speech is not nearly as easy as it used to be. I still do hours of speech therapy each week. And come January, I want to say these two words: ""Madam President.""
So it was important for me to talk to voters in person about why I'm with Hillary: Because she's fighting for our families and for safer communities, and she's the only candidate in this race with the toughness and the record to stand up to the gun lobby in The White House. I want to make my voice heard, and I'm going to keep talking to voters about why I'm with her.
You've spoken out about the importance of women's leadership. What do you admire most about Hillary as a leader?
GG: I admire that Hillary has always been the kind of leader who takes on the tough fights. I admire that, throughout her incredible career, she has always stood up for common sense and stood up to the gun lobby. While the other candidates for president seem downright terrified of the gun lobby, Hillary seems fearless.
As I like to say, strong women get things done. We need more women leaders in public service and at every level of elected office. I'm excited to see Hillary be the first woman in the White House. All of us need to work hard to make sure that happens!
Millions of Americans know firsthand that caregiving is emotionally and physically draining. What has it been like to watch Gabby go through this and be a source of support for her as she learned to walk and talk and become herself again?
MK: The way Gabby has approached her recovery has really showed me what toughness and courage is all about. As she'll tell you, her mantra has been ""move ahead."" I'm just so proud of her.
It has not been an easy road, but we are both very grateful to have a second chance at service and remain focused on the progress she's made and the goals she is working toward now.
Sometimes, when Gabby's getting ready to leave the house to go to a rehab appointment, she'll look at me on her way out the door, pump her fist, and say, ""Fight, fight, fight!""
She inspires me every single day.
More than 33,000 Americans were killed by gun violence last year alone—and a lot of people are throwing up their hands at the idea that anything will be done. What can our next president do that will make a difference? What is it actually going to take to convince Congress that we need commonsense gun legislation? And what can the rest of us do?
GG & MK: We have a gun violence crisis that makes our country stand out in the worst of ways. And unfortunately, the gun lobby and the candidates it backs seem to want to protect this dangerous status quo.
We think our country has to do better—and we think we can. Our next president can continue to make the case for Congress to finally act to keep guns out of the wrong hands; they can stand up for common sense.
Unfortunately, Congress remains in the gun lobby's grip. So if Congress won't act to reduce gun violence, then we can work to have a different Congress.
That's where we can all play a role: we can decide we will only support candidates at every level of elected office - whether they are running for your state legislature, for governor, for Congress, or for the White House—who support commonsense ideas like background checks for all gun sales and have the toughness to stand up to the gun lobby. We can call our elected representatives. And we can work hard to help put a strong, pro-commonsense leader like Hillary in the White House.
Mark, as someone who comes from a STEM field—space exploration!—hearing some of the Republican candidates for president deny that climate change exists because they're ""not a scientist"" must drive you nuts. If you could give them a pre-game speech before the next debate, what would you tell them?
MK: I would ask all Americans to consider that you don't need to be a scientist to believe in science and accept the findings of the scientific community.
I would ask them to think about the Cold War, when the Soviet Union beat us to space. When the Soviets launched Sputnik into space—becoming the first nation on earth to send an object off of our planet—we didn't deny it had happened. We didn't choose to ignore what our scientists at NASA were saying—based on the evidence—had taken place: The Soviets had put a satellite into orbit. Instead, we invested in our space program, in science, and in discovery. And we became leaders in space exploration. It was a huge boon to our economy, to our global leadership, and to our national security.
When it comes to our changing climate, I would ask Americans to listen to our nation's military; to our top intelligence officials; to our business leaders; and to the majority of the world's scientific community.
And I would ask them to listen to our nation's astronauts, too. Because when you see our incredible planet from 250 miles up—as it sits there floating in the blackness of space, with this tiny sliver of an atmosphere protecting it—you have a pretty unique perspective on why we need to take care of it.
What makes you hopeful?
GG & MK: Here's what makes us hopeful and optimistic: The millions of Americans who are calling for commonsense change that makes our communities safer from gun violence.
The leaders in the states who are taking responsible to keep guns out of the wrong hands.
The voters in states like Washington who passed background checks at the ballot box.
Having a president in the White House who acted to keep guns out of the wrong hands since Congress wouldn't.
And knowing we have a candidate for president like Hillary, who has the toughness to take on the gun lobby.

Now, They Are Continuing Her Legacy",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116718,Hillary Clinton,"Kevin Singleton and Denise Quarles follow the example their mother set for them.
Myra Thompson received her certificate to preach at Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston, South Carolina, just hours before she was gunned down during Bible study.
Her grandchildren were also supposed to go with her to Bible study that night, but they had to reschedule.
Kevin Singleton, Myra's son, says it's hard to imagine what could have happened if his children had been with their grandmother.
""These things happen,"" Kevin says, ""and you try not to question fate. But it's hard when someone you love is gone too soon.""
Myra was the type of person who would rather go without than deny help to a person in need. She believed that everything was possible through God, education, and family.
But her life, and the lives of eight other people, came to an abrupt end at the hands of a murderer, who was fueled by racism and hatred.
And he committed what is now known as the Charleston massacre with a gun that he should not have been able to buy?legally.
That's what shocked Myra's daughter, Denise Quarles.
""He took away the most precious person in the world to me,"" Denise says. ""She won't be able to see me get married or have kids ... because he bought a gun that he shouldn't have been able to get.""
Kevin and Denise support Hillary Clinton because they know Hillary will stand up to the gun lobby.
""One of the first things that got my attention was Mrs. Clinton's stance on gun control,"" Denise says. ""She understands that there's no reason for things like this to happen, and she wants to stop gun violence from taking so many people away.""
They also support her because their mother was a strong supporter of Hillary.
""She loved everything Mrs. Clinton stands for,"" Kevin says. ""Hillary is a person that seems to be very serious about her business. They had that in common. And both have strong views about the need for a strong education system, to put kids on the right path in life.""
""She isn't here to speak for herself,"" Denise says, ""to say all the reasons she supported Mrs. Clinton. But I'm here.""
But Kevin and Denise both say they'd still be supporting Hillary, even if their mother were still here today.
""Hillary stands firm on her beliefs, and still gets things done. She's got experience. I trust her,"" Kevin says.
Denise agrees. ""She takes a stand on things,"" she says. ""She believes there needs to be tighter restrictions around guns, which I personally feel a connection to. But there was also the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and how adamant she was that things need to be turned around.""
""As president, she won't just say she's going to do something. She will follow through and actually do it,"" Denise says. ""That's why I support her.""
Every day, Kevin and Denise honor their mother's legacy by lending a helping hand to anyone in need. Kevin runs a nonprofit called Passion to Forgive, which focuses on youth education, and Denise gives guidance to kids in her community.
And by supporting Hillary, they are continuing their mother's fight.
""She told me that Hillary is someone she very much wanted to see as president,"" Denise says. ""We're going to do everything we can to make that happen for her.""

Dear Hillary,
My name is Kevin, and I'm a 26-year-old man living in the suburbs of Atlanta. I work for a non-profit, I pay a mortgage, and I work hard to make ends meet. These are just some of the identities I hold.
I'm also a gay man. I have a husband, Robbin, who is a middle school teacher. We got married in 2014 in New York. When we got back home to Atlanta, we were married in our hearts but unfortunately not in our home state. In 2015 we had to file our state taxes as single, unmarried individuals. We were obviously thrilled with the Supreme Court Obergefell decision in June 2015 because it meant we were officially married at home and everywhere else in the country. However, it was discouraging to see elected leaders all over the country, some even in our own state, vow to work to reverse the outcomes of the decision.
Two months ago (in December 2015), we adopted a baby boy who we named Grey. He is 7 weeks old now. We're so thrilled and excited to be parents; our hearts are so full of love for this child. We felt so relieved that the Obergefell decision paved the way to allow us to adopt as a couple. Previously, we would have had to adopt Grey as single parents and go through the process of adoption twice.
I want you to know that I support you because you have supported me in some of the most delicate and pivotal moments in my life. I remember that day in December of 2011, watching you with tears in my eyes as you said, ""Gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights."" I remember vividly that day in 2013, just six months before Robbin and I got engaged, when you released a video in which you said ""LGBT Americans are our colleagues, our teachers, our soldiers, our friends, our loved ones, and they are full and equal citizens,"" and that they deserve all rights—including marriage. And in October of 2015, the month that Robbin and I would be matched with our soon-to-be born son, you said to the world that ""Being a good parent has nothing to do with your sexual orientation or your gender identity.""
Robbin and I are trying to live the American dream in which we work hard and provide a life that allows our child to succeed and have it better than we did. I know that you understand the depth of love one can feel for their child, and I know that you will appreciate my urgency in feeling like that dream is in danger. Of course, I am a supporter of your campaign for more than just your social policies. However, my family and I have a personal stake in this election that goes beyond just political beliefs and lies at the very core of our identity. I support you because you are the only person running who I trust to keep our family from danger. You are the only person running who has declared that our family is real, valid and deserving. A Republican alternative to you will not look at our family and see all of that. I'm frankly scared of Grey turning on the TV and seeing a Republican president who is outspoken about his belief that gay couples shouldn't be allowed to marry, or that gay parents are not adequate to provide all the opportunities that a heterosexual couple can provide. I am scared of what a Republican president will mean for my family.
For someone that I've never met, you're one of the few people whom I feel has truly supported me. My family and I will do all that we can to get you to the White House in 2016. Attached is a photo of our family and a picture of Grey. Just like us, he has his own Hillary apparel and wants you to know that he's your biggest littlest fan.
Sincerely,
Kevin, Robbin, and Grey

Elena Luisi was trapped in her own body.
At 19, she woke up one morning to find that she couldn't move. Or talk.
At the hospital, she was diagnosed with Wilson's Disease, an illness so rare, it was once featured on an episode of House. The disease wreaks havoc on the body, and while there is no cure, the symptoms are manageable—with the right medications.
After two years of full-time treatment and grueling physical therapy, Elena is back in art school—and walking again. Once a month, she walks to the pharmacy down the street, using a green cane to steady herself. The pharmacist knows her well, smiles, and rings her up.
The cost? $29,404.29. Elena pays $10—she has good health insurance.
Elena's most recent receipt.
Managing the symptoms of Wilson's Disease hinges on a drug called Syprine. Valeant Pharmaceuticals bought the rights to it in 2010—a year before Elena was diagnosed—and raised the price astronomically.
Only about 10,000 people have been diagnosed with Wilson's Disease in the United States. Left untreated, it is fatal.
The practice of jacking up drug prices to make a profit is all too common. And recently, the outrageous actions of companies like Valeant and Turing Pharmaceuticals (remember Martin Shkreli?) have landed them the in headlines. A new investigation in Congress by Representative Elijah Cummings reveals they boasted about their actions—treating human beings as a 'price play' and putting profits before patients.
Predatory pharmaceutical companies like Valeant and Turing are profiting on people like Elena. Her disease is rare, and with virtually no other treatment options, drug companies know they can drive up the price of lifesaving medications because people will have no choice but to pay. So in some cases, that's exactly what they do.
Recently, Hillary Clinton called out Valeant Pharmaceuticals for their predatory practices—and made it clear that she is ready, willing, and eager to take them on as president.
"" I'm going after them. We are going to stop this. This is predatory pricing. It is unjustified. It is wrong. And we're going to make sure this is stopped.""—Hillary Clinton
She also made it overwhelmingly clear what she plans to do about it.
"" I will have the Justice Department and every tool at my disposal to go after these companies that are doing this to people who need the help.""—Hillary Clinton
Hillary's policy proposals to address this problem, in addition to decades of experience and intricate knowledge of health care policy, mean that people like Elena can focus on what's important: getting and staying healthy.
Glow, by Elena Luisi
That means the world to families around the country. And I would know— because Elena is my younger sister.
Elena and me. Even though she's seven years younger—she's almost a foot taller than I am, even in 5-inch heels.
After Elena was diagnosed, I was lucky that I could afford to leave the workforce temporarily to help care for her. I can't imagine what that must be like for family members who aren't as fortunate. Hillary has proposed a plan to make it easier for caretakers, too.
Growing up, Elena could never ride a bike thanks to what we now know is Wilson's Disease. About a year and a half into her recovery, I bought her a giant tricycle and took this picture of her first bike ride—ever.
For my family, the stakes in this election aren't abstract—the only thing standing between Elena and a $29,403.29 monthly bill is the Affordable Care Act. Before, Elena would have blown through her lifetime cap in months, and you can bet that Wilson's Disease would have qualified as a ""pre-existing condition.""
In three years, at 26, she'll be too old to stay on our dad's insurance—which will put her at the mercy of another insurance company. In fact, the cost of her medication went up another $2,000 over the holidays alone, and nobody knows when the insurance company will start passing that outrageous price tag on to our family.
There are thousands of families across the country that face debilitating illness with courage and dignity. We do not deserve to spend hours on the phone with our insurance companies, begging them to cover outrageous costs thanks to immoral, predatory, and ruthless pricing schemes—and that's why I moved to Brooklyn to work on Hillary's campaign for president, because she will protect, strengthen, and build upon Obamacare.
My family deserves better. And I know that Hillary Clinton will fight—and win—for Elena, for me, and for thousands of families like mine. Por eso, #EstoyConElla.

Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders share a lot of big progressive goals—but they differ in how they plan to achieve them.?
Here's how The New York Times put it in their recent endorsement:
"" In the end, though, Mr. Sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs. Clinton offers. His boldest proposals — to break up the banks and to start all over on health care reform with a Medicare-for-all system—have earned him support among alienated middle-class voters and young people. But his plans for achieving them aren't realistic, while Mrs. Clinton has very good, and achievable, proposals in both areas.""New York Times
For example, on preventing gun violence:
Don't take our word for it. Just ask the gun lobby:
Wayne LaPierre, NRA CEO and Executive Vice President
And here are their plans for addressing ISIS and the threat of global terror.
And when it comes to ending the nation's substance abuse epidemic, only one candidate has a plan.
And as far as reining in Wall Street?
We need a president who knows how to deliver real results—and that's exactly what Hillary's campaign is all about. Read more about her policy proposals here."

During a CNN town hall, Rabbi?Jonathan Spira-Savett asked Hillary Clinton how she balances the?ambition it takes to run for president and the humility that it requires to live a life of service.
As a person of faith, Hillary has been asking herself this question for a long time.


She told the rabbi that her faith compelled her to a career in politics: She is running for president because she believes in doing the most good for the most people. And she is reminded of that at the beginning of every day.


Hillary also revealed the piece of scripture that she turns to most often during difficult times.
""I read a treatment of the Prodigal Son parable,"" she said. ""There was a line in it that became a lifeline for me.""?


She spends each day working to practice that discipline.

Hillary knows we've fought too hard—and too many people rely on the Affordable Care Act—to start over.

Hillary Clinton used her closing statement at the Democratic debate to bring up a few important issues they didn't get to talk about—but she was determined to mention.
"" We didn't get to talk about the continuing struggles that Americans face with racism, with sexism, with discrimination against the LGBT community, with New Americans, with people with disabilities.""
Hillary has been fighting to address these issues throughout her career—and this campaign. Here's where she stands:
Taking on systemic racism:
""The opportunity gap that America is facing is not just about economic inequality. It is about racial inequality.""
National Urban League Conference, July 31, 2015
Ending discrimination against the LGBT community:
""Congress must pass the federal Equality Act. That law would finally outlaw discrimination against LGBT people basically everywhere?—?in employment, housing, public education, public accommodations, access to federal funding and credit, and in the jury system.""
Human Rights Campaign Breakfast, October 3, 2015
Fixing our broken immigration system:
""If we really want to strengthen families, then we have to finally, once and for all, fix our broken immigration system.""
National Association of Latino Elected Officials 32nd Annual Conference, June 18, 2015
Fighting for the rights of Americans with disabilities:
""We should acknowledge how the disabilities community has played such an important role in changing things for the better in our country.""
On the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, June 26, 2015
And she has a long history of fighting to make a difference.
"" I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman—about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders' supporters—worrying about what I could do to make a difference for my country, and I will bring that heart with me.

With just a few days to go until the New Hampshire primary, Hillary has been hitting the campaign trail across the Granite State.
And yesterday, she brought a few of her friends along.
These aren't just any friends—they're some of the toughest, hardest-working, most effective leaders in America. They're helping to elect Hillary Clinton because she's a progressive who gets things done—and over the years, they've seen her fight for the values they share and deliver real results.
Meet the lineup:
Left to right: Stephanie Schriock 1, Kirsten Gillibrand 2, Maggie Hassan 3, Amy Klobuchar 4, Debbie Stabenow 5, Hillary Clinton 6, Jeanne Shaheen 7, and Lilly Ledbetter 8.
1. Stephanie Schriock
President of EMILY's List—an organization dedicated to shattering glass ceilings at every level of politics. In high school, won an election for student body president by campaigning among underclassmen and earning a key endorsement from her male opponent's younger sister. She's been helping women (and a few men) run for office and win ever since.
2. Kirsten Gillibrand
Senator from New York. Senator Gillibrand succeeded Hillary Clinton in the U.S. Senate. Among other things—taking on the issue of sexual assault in the military and on college campuses, fighting for family friendly workplace policies, to name a few—she has worked hard to bring women ""off the sidelines"" and into the political process. 
3. Maggie Hassan
Current governor of New Hampshire—and hopefully, next senator. As governor, she built a bipartisan consensus to balance the budget and extend health coverage to tens of thousands of people. Has a well deserved reputation for working hard and getting things done.
4. Amy Klobuchar
First woman senator from Minnesota. Straight-talker who is taking on the challenges that make the headlines and the ones that keep families up at night. When asked about the difference it makes to have more women in the Senate, she said: ""Women tend to be problem solvers, we work together ... They didn't get there by swaggering around, they got there by getting things done.""
5. Debbie Stabenow
Senator from Michigan. Currently doing everything she can to support the people of Flint and make sure that there is an appropriate response at all levels of government in the wake of this heartbreaking and unacceptable crisis. Fighting to create good paying jobs, expand access to health care, protect the environment, and more.
6. Hillary Clinton
Former first lady of Arkansas, first lady of the United States, first woman senator from New York, Secretary of State, running for president to build a country and a world where everyone, everywhere can live up to their potential. Pantsuit expert. 
7. Jeanne Shaheen
The only woman in American history—until Maggie Hassan—to be elected both governor and senator. A fierce and unapologetic champion for women's health and rights, including equal pay and Planned Parenthood.
8. Lilly Ledbetter

Hillary Clinton went to Flint, Michigan, 1 to talk directly with residents 2 about how the water crisis, 3 an issue close to her heart, 4 has affected their lives. Along with Flint Mayor Karen Weaver 5 and members of Hillary's staff, 6 she attended a community meeting 7 to discuss what steps need to be taken to help the children and families of Flint, now and in the future,8 and develop a plan to help the many other communities experiencing similar problems 9.
1. Hillary Clinton went to Flint...
"" I feel blessed to be here. But I'm wishing it were for a different reason.""Feburary 7, 2016
Located 66 miles northwest of Detroit, Flint, Michigan was once the primary manufacturing center for GM's Chevrolet and Buick lines. When the auto industry was hit during the recession, GM eliminated jobs in Flint, leaving many people without a way to provide for their families. The city has a long history of financial troubles—in 2011, a financial state of emergency was declared for Flint, which gave the state more power to control the city's finances.
Hillary went to Flint to hear directly from a community whose concerns have too often been overlooked and ignored.
2. ... to talk directly with residents ...
"" If the same thing that's happening in Flint had happened in Grosse Pointe or Bloomfield Hills, I think we all know that we would've had a solution yesterday.""February 7, 2016
The majority of Flint residents are African American, and more than 40 percent live below the poverty line. An estimated 1,000 undocumented immigrants live in the city as well.
"" When the children of majority­-black Flint, Michigan, have been drinking and bathing in lead­ poisoned water for more than a year, making sure all Americans have clean air and water isn't just a health issue. It's a civil rights issue. We would be outraged if this happened to white kids, and we should be outraged that it's happening right now to black kids.""January 18, 2016
3. ... about how the water crisis ...
"" I am here because for almost two years, Flint's water was poisoned. I'm here because, for nearly two years, mothers and fathers were voicing concerns about the water's color, the smell, the rashes it gave to those bathing in it. For nearly two years, you were told—Flint was told—the water was safe.""February 7, 2016
In March of 2014, in the midst of a budget crisis, officials switched the city's water source to the Flint River—a waterway infamous for its filth—in order save money.
Water coming in from the river eroded the city's lead pipes—and that lead seeped into the tap water. Residents noticed the dirty water right away, but their concerns went largely ignored.
For nearly two years, high levels of lead have plagued the drinking water in Flint, and now many of the city's children have much higher than normal lead levels in their blood.
The crisis will affect Flint residents for decades to come. No amount of exposure to lead is safe—and in children, lead poisoning can cause irreparable damage to brain development, and lead to learning and behavioral problems.
4. ... an issue close to her heart ...
"" When I first heard about what was happening here, I was so angry. I was outraged. And I know you must feel exactly the same.""February 7, 2016
As soon as Hillary first heard what was happening in Flint, she dispatched senior members of her campaign staff to find out what could be done to help.
She's been bringing attention to the issue ever since.
Hillary on January 14:
Hillary on January 18:
Hillary on February 7:
"" We don't yet know how many children have been affected by lead poisoning. We don't yet know how many challenges they may face in the years ahead. But ... we know that even a single child suffering lead poisoning due to the state's neglect is one child too many. And we also know we need action now.""
This is not a new fight for Hillary—she's spent her career fighting for children and families. As senator from New York, she took on the problem of lead poisoning in children, and fought to bring more support for lead paint and soil remediation in New York and across the country.
5. ... has affected their lives. Along with Flint Mayor Karen Weaver...
"" I thank the elected officials that are here. The pastor asked them to stand, and I appreciate the work they do greatly—at the city, the county, and the federal level.""February 7, 2016
Hillary was invited to Flint by city's mayor, Karen Weaver, who was elected in November, 2015—two years after the water crisis began. She campaigned on a platform of fixing the crisis once and for all, and got to work the minute she was elected.
Mayor Weaver has said that Hillary Clinton is the only presidential candidate who is actively working to fix things in Flint.
"" We need someone there fighting for the city of Flint, making sure we're getting what we need. Hillary has shown us that's what kind of person she is—and what kind of president she'll be. She gets results. And that's what we need.""Karen Weaver, January 21, 2016
6. ... and members of Hillary's staff ...
"" We need to keep the spotlight bright.""February 7, 2016

Multiple members of Hillary Clinton's team were on the ground with her, including Maya Harris, senior policy advisor; Karen Finney, senior spokesperson; LaDavia Drane, African American outreach director; and Amanda Renteria, national political director.
Amanda was one of the first staff members Hillary sent to investigate the water crisis in Flint. She worked with the mayor's team on the ground, figuring out what needed to be done to help the children of Flint.
""Hillary was immediately concerned,"" Amanda says, ""especially for the children in the area. You know, she's a mother and a grandmother, and when she heard children were being poisoned she immediately wanted us to get up there and find out if those children are being cared for, if people in the city had access to safe drinking water, and what the long-term plan is for this city.""
7. ... she attended a community meeting ...
"" This is not merely unacceptable or wrong, though it is both. What happened in Flint is immoral. The children of Flint are just as precious as the children in any other part of America. They are just as deserving of good health care, of good education, and of bright futures.""February 7, 2016
Hillary met with the mayor and other elected officials to debrief on the situation and discuss what steps must be taken to help Flint now—and to help the children affected for many years to come. She also addressed Flint residents at a community meeting, and met with mothers whose children are suffering from health problems after drinking tap water in Flint.
8. ... to discuss what steps need to be taken to help the children and families of Flint, now and in the future ...
"" I want you to understand that this is, for me, a personal commitment. I will stand with you every step of the way. I will not for one minute forget about you or forget about your children. I will do everything I can to help you get back up, to get your strength and resilience flowing through this community again. Because what happened here should never have happened anywhere.""February 7, 2016
Hillary is committed to doing everything she can to solve the immediate crisis in Flint, and she'll keep fighting against environmental racism as president.
"" ... as president, I will make environmental justice a central part of my comprehensive commitment to low-income communities of color ... Because clean air and clean water are basic human rights—and our rights shouldn't change between ZIP codes. ""
"" Communities and kids across our country have been bearing the burden of environmental racism for too long. It's harming their health, their education, every aspects of their lives and futures. We can no longer accept the status quo—and as president, I never will.""January 30, 2016
And that doesn't stop in Flint.
9. ... and develop a plan to help the many other communities experiencing similar problems.
"" This is not the only place where children are being harmed by what they breathe and what they drink.""February 7, 2016
""Flint isn't alone,"" Hillary has said. ""There are a lot more Flints out there—overwhelmingly low-income communities of color where pollution, toxic chemicals, and staggering neglect adds to families' burdens.""
There's still work to do in Flint and across our country. But Hillary is never going to give up on the families who have been harmed, dismissed, and belittled by those they should have been able to count on for help. And neither can we.
Speaking at the community meeting this morning, Hillary had a message for those working to address the crisis in Flint—and everyone fighting for justice, everywhere.

The New Hampshire primary is tomorrow, and it's going to be a close one. Every single person we can get to the polls could make the difference.
I'm going to let you in on a little campaign secret: There's one nearly surefire way to get someone to vote.
Ask them.
In all likelihood, you don't live in New Hampshire. Guess what? Neither do I—but I have a few friends who live in the Granite State, and I bet you do too.
Please believe that the most important thing you can do right now to help Hillary on Tuesday is send a Facebook message to your friends in New Hampshire.?
Step one: Find them on Facebook.?Click this link and they'll pop up.
Step two: Send a message to each of your New Hampshire friends. If you really don't know anyone who lives there, post something anyway—you never know who you'll inspire.
So for example, I might say something like:
Hey, New Hampshire friend/long-lost cousin/college roommate I haven't spoken to in forever—
I know you're planning to vote tomorrow, right?!
And if you're still making up your mind about who to vote for, I hope you'll check out Hillary Clinton's positions and see where she stands. I know you've always been concerned about college affordability—did you know Hillary has a smart, detailed plan for that? It's one of the reasons I'm working so hard to elect her.

Outside the YWCA in downtown Manchester, New Hampshire, a winter storm is blanketing the city. There's nearly half a foot of fresh snow on the ground—and it just keeps coming down. The morning-drive DJs on local radio stations suggest staying indoors.
But step inside the YWCA, and hundreds of Granite Staters are bustling about, getting ready to start knocking on doors. There are just a few days left until the New Hampshire primary, and a little snow won't keep them inside for long—not when their candidate, Hillary Clinton, needs them to talk to as many voters as possible before Tuesday's election.
As Joni, a 74-year-old veteran volunteer, says in between checking in fellow canvassers, ""This is nothing. This is just a light snowstorm. And it's typical Hillary campaign behavior: Let's get this done, let's do it right, and let's win this election.""
But if there's anyone in the crowd who needs a little extra motivation to go out and knock doors in a snowstorm, they get it—in the form of a pep talk straight from the candidate (and a few of her most inspiring friends).
Hillary tells them: ""You can tell people you're talking to today, bring both their heart and their head. Bring them both Tuesday. And help us all begin to move toward making sure we have a Democratic president once again in the White House.""
After Hillary says goodbye, the last selfie is taken, and the television cameras power down, the real work begins. The crowd inside the YWCA disperses across Manchester, bringing their hearts and their heads, their personal stories, and their best arguments to their neighbors—whatever it takes to get the job done for Hillary next Tuesday.
Everyone has their own reason for going out into the snow—here are four of them:
JUDI: ""I didn't realize how much passion I had until I started helping out on her campaign. She stands for what I believe in. Because of Hillary, I got involved in the political process back in 2007. Because of her, I kept on going—even after she didn't win the nomination. And I made a promise to her that it's going to happen this time. I believe in her. She's such a strong candidate, and I want so badly for her to be our president.""
MAHENDRA: ""I flew back from Mumbai yesterday. I landed in Boston at 5:30 p.m., which was two hours later than planned. I was supposed to be canvassing during the 6 p.m. shift that night. So I called my organizer, Katie, from Logan Airport and told her the plane got in too late, but I still wanted to start canvassing first thing today. It was my birthday, and I really wanted to canvass for Hillary on my birthday.""
JEANIE: ""I was in a local orphanage in the 1950s, when I was 5 years old. I didn't speak—I was too frightened. And when I grew up, I found my voice. I found out Hillary had been an advocate for kids since she got out of school. That was the hook for me—she has never stopped fighting for children. She would have been my voice as a little girl. And now that I'm retired, it's my time to be out there for her. I had this hat made just for the campaign. People ask me about it all the time, and it's my introduction to telling them about this very special woman named Hillary Clinton.""
KATHLEEN: ""When it comes down to it, Hillary stands for fairness. As a woman, she knows what it's like to fight to be treated with the same respect as a man. Unions are all about being treated fairly and with respect. We can cut wood, we can paint, we can do electrical work. We can do all the things men can do—including being president.""

Hillary fought for every vote in the New Hampshire primary. And when she came up short, she took the stage to address the thousands of people who worked so hard for her in the Granite State.
""I want to begin by congratulating Senator Sanders on his victory tonight. And I want to thank each and every one of you.
""And here's what we're going to do: Now we take this campaign to the entire country. We're going to fight for every vote in every state.
""It isn't right that the kids I met in Flint on Sunday were poisoned because their governor wanted to save money.""
""People have every right to be angry. But they're also hungry. They're hungry for solutions.""
And Hillary made an important pledge:
"" Here's what I'll promise: I will work harder than anyone to actually make the changes that make your lives better.""
She talked about the many things that she and Senator Sanders agree on—like the need to overturn Citizens United and guarantee that Wall Street can never be allowed to once again threaten Main Street.
But she also talked about the choice voters have in this election.
"" The real differences in this race are truly over how do we create a future of prosperity, opportunity, and security for all of us.""
She vowed to ""break through the barriers of bigotry"" and make sure that nothing is holding Americans back.
""African American parents shouldn't have to worry that their children will be harassed, humiliated, even shot because of the color of their skin. Immigrant families shouldn't have to lie awake at night listening for a knock on the door. LGBT Americans shouldn't be fired from their jobs because of who they are or who they love. And let's finally deliver something long overdue: equal pay for women in this economy.""
And she reminded the audience that this is not a new fight for her.
""We need to break down those barriers and build ladders of opportunity for every person. That has been the cause and work of my life.""
"" When children anywhere in our country go to bed hungry, or are denied a quality education, or who face abuse or abandonment, that diminishes all of us.""
""That's why I did start my career at the Children's Defense Fund ...""
""That's why I went undercover in Alabama to expose racism in schools. That's why I worked to reform juvenile justice in South Carolina.""
""And that is why I went to Flint, Michigan, on Sunday.""
"" When people anywhere in America are held back by injustice, that demands action. ""
""That's why I believe so strongly that we have to keep up—with every fiber of our being—the campaign for human rights ... across the board for every single American.
""This is who I am. This is what I've always done. This is why I am in this race.""
She thanked everyone who is helping to make this campaign what it is—and build a better tomorrow for all our children and grandchildren.
""I'm very grateful to my wonderful family. Knowing they are by my side, it keeps me going every day.""
""To the thousands of volunteers and organizers who called neighbors and knocked on doors in the New Hampshire snow ...""
""More than 700,000 people have contributed to this campaign, the vast majority giving less than $100. I know that doesn't fit with the narrative. I know there are those who want to deny the passion and the purpose you all show every day for this campaign.""
""But you are the reason we're here. You're the reason we're going to win this nomination and then win this election together.""

On a cold Saturday in February, Hillary Clinton set up shop on a college campus. She invited students to ask her anything they wanted—whether they were planning to vote for her or not.
The first question came from Jack Lovell, a 17 year old wearing a Bernie Sanders campaign button.
Jack: Now, that also surrounds you with a certain amount of distrust from the American people. What do you say to the people that hold this distrust, and how would you gain their trust?
Hillary: That's a very fair question.
Afterward, Jack described his experience coming into the event.

He came to the event because he wanted to see a different side of Hillary—and that's exactly what happened.


He summed up what he had seen, and how it changed his opinion of Hillary:
""Originally,"" Jack says, ""I thought she was a regular politician who was going to talk about herself and defuse every question.""

Hillary Clinton is gearing up to take the stage in the sixth Democratic debate of the presidential primary. And if her past performances are any indication, it's safe to say she's got this. Here are the five moments from previous debates that perfectly sum up her campaign.
1. She's always the first—and often the only—candidate to stand up to Republican attacks on Planned Parenthood.
2. She has clear, detailed policy plans—and she's always specific about how she'll make them a reality.
3. She's never afraid to take on the gun lobby—and she does it again, and again, and again.

She knows the gritty specifics of health care policy, and she gained extensive foreign policy experience as secretary of state. The former first lady and U.S. senator is a planner, a detail-oriented leader with refined positions that are not easily condensed into an applause line. She also has demonstrated her skill as a negotiator and as a determined advocate in all sorts of situations over a lifetime in the public eye.""Tampa Bay Times
"" But most important, as first lady, a U.S. senator from New York and secretary of state, Clinton has demonstrated a broader sense of proportion, pragmatism and accomplishment than has Sanders.""San Antonio Express-News
... and she's a progressive who gets things done—someone who knows what it takes to make progress in Washington.
"" As president, she'd push a mostly liberal agenda, as Sanders would. But her passion for change is leavened by a pragmatism—and a recognition of costs—his lacks. She still supports universal health care, for example. But she's wisely content to defend and, where possible, extend the Affordable Care Act.""Dallas Morning News
"" Improving economic opportunities for every American will require multiple approaches. Clinton has a diversified strategy that includes raising the minimum wage, closing corporate tax loopholes and investing in infrastructure and renewable energy. While she is criticized for her ties to Wall Street, she is a strong supporter of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations and would strengthen oversight of the biggest banks. She has achievable goals for lowering college costs and reducing student debt, and she would build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act by seeking to lower deductibles and drug costs.""Tampa Bay Times
"" The race for the Democratic presidential nomination is between a candidate who wants to ignite a revolution and another who promises a push for progressive incrementalism.Choosing the former may be enticing to some, but the latter is far more preferable if you are interested in what is far more doable. That difference alone makes Hillary Clinton the best choice for president in the Democratic primary, but she is far better prepared for the job as well.""San Antonio Express-News
Her experience as secretary of state would make her the commander in chief we need.
"" She crisscrossed the globe, tirelessly strengthening this country's diplomatic reach in the face of fast-evolving security threats and global crises. That's experience that none of her rivals, in either party, can match.""Dallas Morning News
"" In this era of terrorist threats and chest-thumping by Russia and North Korea, Clinton's experience as secretary of state would be particularly helpful. ... Clinton is a known player with deep relationships around the world, and the ability to build coalitions and effectively confront adversaries without provoking all-out war has never been more valuable.""Tampa Bay Times
"" ... as secretary of state, she helped Obama chart a foreign policy course weighted more properly toward diplomacy than military might, while talking about gender equality and other human rights around the world.""San Antonio Express-News
And above all, Hillary has proven herself as a fighter—and the best choice to be our next president.
"" ... in the half century since she traveled Texas for McGovern, Clinton has shown persistence beyond measure. That has given her time to learn the value of compromise. That's why she's the best choice for Democrats.""Dallas Morning News
"" Clinton has been battle-tested, and she is better prepared to be president than when she lost to Obama in the 2008 primaries. The fight for the Democratic nomination may last far longer than anticipated, but only Clinton can win in November and is prepared for the nation's highest office. For the Democratic nomination for president, the Tampa Bay Times recommends Hillary Clinton.""Tampa Bay Times
"" Her service as U.S. senator and secretary of state—and the many hits she has taken simply because she bears the name Clinton—have forged a steely and calm approach that makes her more presidential than Sanders. ... Clinton's nomination by Democrats would say much about how far the country has come on gender, but ultimately she is simply the better candidate—by far—in the Democratic race.""San Antonio Express-News

In January, Hillary heard about the poisoning of the water supply in Flint and told us that we needed to act. A few hours later, I was on a plane heading to Michigan.
Michigan is a very special place to me. Before working for Hillary, I served as Senator Debbie Stabenow's chief of staff. I fell in love with the state—its beautiful landscapes, its tremendous manufacturing. I learned that grit and charm are at the heart of what it means to be from Michigan.
It's hard to describe in words what parents and kids are going through in Flint, but I immediately sensed the worry and frustration when I saw them eye to eye.
I saw Mayor Karen Weaver's determination to keep advocating on behalf of the community, even when others were saying she couldn't make a difference. I saw the relief of a local journalist when she realized that someone was finally listening to what she had been reporting for months. And I saw the deep faith of ministers in and around Flint, who were doing everything they could to guide their congregations through such tough times.
When I reported all of this to Hillary, she insisted on seeing it for herself.
Why? Because Hillary has spent her entire life fighting for families and for communities like Flint. She wanted to hear directly from the people who are being affected so that she could find ways to make a practical difference in their lives. This is what she does.
When Hillary got to Flint, we headed to a church. We sat together as she bore witness to the pain of a mom who has tried to shield her son from all the ills of the world, only to be invaded in her own home by poisoned water. At every meal, every bath, every turn—for nearly two years. She spoke with another mom who is now running to doctor's appointments while trying to help others who are even worse off than she is.
I don't even know how they got through their stories.
And no one could overlook the 6-year-old in the room, Jaylon. He's the same age as my own son, so his presence touched me personally. Jaylon loved taking pictures, and he spent the meeting snapping photos on his phone.?
It was hard for us to hear Jaylon's mom say how much she loved him, and how difficult it was for him without help at school. It was hard for Jaylon to hear, too. While his mom talked, he hid behind his phone. But when she was done, Jaylon peeked up and smiled at us. It made us all laugh—and we needed that.
When Jaylon was done taking pictures, we headed to the sanctuary—a room full of love, prayer, and cheers. Pastor Stewart welcomed Hillary to the pulpit, and she began: ""This is the day the Lord has made ... ""
"" This is not merely unacceptable or wrong, though it is both. What happened in Flint is immoral. The children of Flint are just as precious as the children in any other part of America.""
Hillary cares about all of our families and neighbors. That's why she assured the city's estimated 1,000 undocumented immigrants that they wouldn't be left out. And that's why she finished her speech with this:
"" I will be there with you, and I will make sure in any way I can that America stays with you too. And I look forward to coming back to Flint, to seeing this community rise, rise again, rise with determination, resilience, support, service, leadership. We can do this.""
Before saying goodbye, Hillary found Jaylon and his mother. Jaylon asked Barb Kinney, our campaign photographer, if he could try out her camera. She obliged.
With Hillary's leadership, we can work together and get Flint back on its feet. And if we do, I have no doubt that Jaylon's grit and charm will take care of the rest.
Jaylon takes a photo of Barb Kinney, the official campaign photographer.

For two years, the people of Flint, Michigan, complained that their water was murky, that it smelled bad, that bathing in it gave them rashes—and for two years, they were told they were wrong, and that their water was safe.
But it wasn't. It was poisoned, and the children of Flint were drinking it.
I traveled to Flint last weekend at the invitation of Mayor Karen Weaver to talk with residents and community leaders.
The people I met were passionate, thoughtful, and tireless—one 6 year old came to our meeting, and his mom spoke about how she'd tried so hard to shield her son from the ills of the world, only to learn she'd been giving him baths in poisoned water.
What happened in Flint is the cruelest kind of indifference, and an affront to what we stand for as a nation.
Clean water is not optional, and it's not a luxury—it's a basic human right.
The children of Flint are just as deserving of bright futures as the children of any other community. And today, those children need our help.
If you can, please chip in to support the Flint Child Health & Development Fund, which is working to provide health care and educational support to families in Flint affected by this crisis.
We know that lead poisoning can affect kids for their whole lives, so 100 percent of your donation will help provide ongoing services for the next 20 years to the most vulnerable families in Flint:
We need to keep talking about Flint, and we need to make sure that every child in this country can grow up to reach his or her God-given potential—no matter where they come from, the color of their skin, or how much money their parents make.
Thank you for standing with me in this fight and so many others. Thank you for doing your part to help the children of Flint.
With deep appreciation,
Hillary

Fox and Angela Bassett, Campaigning For Hillary Clinton in South Carolina",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116714,Hillary Clinton,"A very busy day with two incredible women
I love my job, because every day is different. As the digital director for Hillary Clinton's campaign in South Carolina, my job can mean a lot of different things—from creating and maintaining the campaign's online presence in the state to also spending my days on the trail, talking directly to voters, volunteers, and working with elected officials and celebrities who campaign for Hillary.
But this Wednesday was particularly special. At 6 a.m. I found myself climbing into my car to pick up Vivica A. Fox (!) for events across the state.
Vivica A. Fox and Angela Bassett spent three days on the campaign trail this week, urging people to get out the vote for Hillary in South Carolina.
These two lovely ladies are in SC campaigning for @HillaryClinton! @ImAngelaBassett @MsVivicaFox @HillaryforSC pic.twitter.com/HdvLRFaxMu— Jalisa Washington (@J_WashingtonSC) February 9, 2016
During the ride to our first stop of the day, Vivica and I discussed the reasons she's hitting the trail for Hillary. She talked about how important it is for us to protect all of the progress President Obama has made, especially with the Affordable Care Act and the president's work to reduce gun violence—because these issues disproportionately affect the African American community. She also shared how much she loves Hillary's New College Compact, which allocates $25 billion specifically for supporting HBCUs.
She made it clear that she's ready to fight for Hillary, and I couldn't wait to see Vivica share her passion with the people of South Carolina.
First stop: WACH News in Columbia.
Thx @MsVivicaFox 4 stopping @wachfox to talk @EmpireFOX @IndependenceDay & @HillaryClinton https://t.co/AEf1fhG0UD pic.twitter.com/M1TjMZvci0— Fraendy Clervaud (@FraendyNewsman) February 9, 2016
During her interview, Vivica talked about her roles in the wildly successful television show, Empire, and the highly-anticipated movie, Independence Day: Resurgence—but she also shared the reason she came to Columbia.
?I am SO here to support Hillary Clinton,? she told Fraendy Clervaud on Good Day Columbia.
?We have to keep things going forward. ? And I just feel that, with Secretary Clinton, we're going to keep going forward.?
She also urged people to make sure their voices are heard in this election.
?Make sure that you pay attention. Saturday, February 27 is the day to get out and vote. ? This election is so important, so make sure you go vote.?
Vivica then joined all of the hosts to wrap up the show, and one host asked her why she chose to spend her time campaigning for Hillary.
?Now you're a very busy lady,? the host said. ?So what made you decide, of all the things you have to do, that you had to get behind Hillary??
Before the host could get the whole question out, Vivica was answering.
?Because I care about my community, and I care about our country. ? People think that I'm out in Hollywood, and that I don't care about the community. I've always been y'all's favorite sister girl, who cares about the community. And so I'm making sure that they have to understand, especially Generation X, that their vote counts.?
Meanwhile, Clay Middleton, the South Carolina state director, was spending the day with Angela Bassett. During Vivica's TV interview, I got this message from him.
Safe to say that Angela was having a pretty great time on the trail, too.
Second stop: WFMV 95.3
Angela and Vivica both had radio interviews scheduled, so we headed to WMFV 95.3, Columbia's Inspiration Station.
Thx 2 @MsVivicaFox 4 coming by 2 hang out w/ us today, she'll be LIVE w/ @jamalbates at 4:30pm! @antjuansea pic.twitter.com/xpwRUDuqnj— WFMV 95.3 FM (@wfmv953) February 9, 2016
Clay texted to let me know how Angela's radio interview was going.
Third stop: The South Carolina State House
Clay and Angela met up with us at the South Carolina statehouse in Columbia, where both women met with local officials.
You never know who you'll see at the State House...today the Senate got a visit from @MsVivicaFox & @ImAngelaBassett pic.twitter.com/rY6FadftAN— Sen. Thomas McElveen (@ThomasMcElveen) February 10, 2016

Angela and Vivica talked with Democratic leaders about the importance of this election. Vivica told everyone that she knew how much of our progress was at stake, and she was there to help them make sure we keep a Democrat in the White House.
Thanks to our special guest, @MsVivicaFox who's here campaigning for @HillaryClinton #sctweets pic.twitter.com/VvdYs5Skvw— SC House Democrats (@SCHouseDems) February 9, 2016
And when a group of General Assembly members held a press conference to endorse Hillary, Angela and Vivica stood alongside them, proudly declaring that they're on Team Hillary, too.
Fourth stop: Voorhees College in Denmark
After that, we got back on the road. Vivica and I drove to Voorhees College, an HBCU in Denmark.
After the event, a few students came up to her and said ""I'm going to vote now!"" It was incredibly encouraging to see Vivica's message resonating with students. At the same time, Clay was with Angela at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, where a HUGE crowd turned out.
Fifth stop: Denmark Technical College
Vivica and I headed to Denmark Tech, a two-year technical college, where she gave another great speech about all of the ways Hillary's policies will break down barriers for African Americans.
And after Angela finished rallying students at Claflin University in Orangeburg, Clay told me she got the chance to meet up with some of Delta sorors!
Then, without missing a beat, Vivica and I headed to the young professionals happy hour in Columbia, while Angela and Clay made their way to one in Charleston.
Sixth stop: Young Professionals Happy Hour at Kaminsky's
By the time we arrived at Kaminsky's, a bar in Columbia, Vivica was more enthusiastic than ever.
The bar was packed—there must have been at least 150 people there throughout the night. Vivica took photos with every single person who asked—but not before reminding them to make sure their voices are heard by heading to the polls on February 27 and supporting Hillary.
I made a friend tonight! ???? @MsVivicaFox it was a pleasure! pic.twitter.com/LWeeEGq8iB— Maxwell (@HauzOfMax) February 10, 2016

Clay sent me updates throughout the night on the happy hour Angela was hosting in Charleston.
In the car on our way back to her hotel, all Vivica could talk about were the events she'd be doing the next day. I assumed she'd be exhausted—she'd had a crazy day on the trail! But she was totally ready to get back out there and keep fighting for Hillary.
?I was so moved by the students who came out and were engaged,? she said. ?It really means a lot to me that I'm taking part in electing Hillary Clinton.? She talked about how important HBCU organizing is to her, because she knows that Hillary will make sure all of the students she talked to will have a better life.
Last stop of the day: Vivica's hotel
Vivica and I said our goodbyes for the night, after a long day on the road.
When I got home, Clay sent me this video of two little girls coming to say hi to Angela. One of them complimented her on her Hillary button—and Angela gave it to her.

This entire day meant so much to me and the South Carolina team. Vivica A. Fox and Angela Bassett spent their time with us because they believe that Hillary Clinton will make it possible for everyone we met to live up to their God-given potential.
And the next morning? We all headed back out to do it all over again, because both women know that Hillary needs them, and—like Angela said—we know we can count on Hillary, and we have to make sure Hillary can count on South Carolina.
GM! She's fabulous,smarter, and she is so ready 2 lead this country. @HillaryClinton is my choice for president. #ImWithHer #Blessed ;)— Vivica A. Fox (@MsVivicaFox) February 10, 2016
Hey everybody, you good?After time on the road w/@HillaryforSC, I can CONFIDENTLY say: #ImWithHer because she's with us! @HillaryClinton— Angela Bassett (@ImAngelaBassett) February 10, 2016"

When a vacancy opens up on the Supreme Court, the president has a responsibility to nominate a new justice—and the Senate has a responsibility to vote. But hours after Justice Antonin Scalia died, Republicans in the Senate and on the campaign trail pledged to block any replacement justice President Obama nominates.
With so many issues in front of the court right now, their actions would have a direct and immediate impact on millions of lives. Hillary Clinton knows the American people can't wait, and she's taking Republicans to task.

He knows Hillary will fix it.
More than 650,000 people are released from prison every year. Many of these people have an incredibly difficult time getting back on their feet: Surveys show 60 percent of former prisoners experience long-term unemployment. Hillary has a plan to reform the criminal justice system, end the era of mass incarceration, and give people who have served time a second chance—people like Mikey Cole.
-----
Just a few blocks away from the New York City projects he grew up in, Mikey Cole serves customers while bragging on the sixth grader who has just walked into his ice cream shop, Mikey Likes It.
""This little man is a genius!"" Mikey says, gesturing with his ice cream scoop as the student's mother stands in the doorway, smiling. ""Tell them what you want to be when you grow up!""
""A nuclear astrophysicist,"" the kid says, proudly. ""I just started at a new school.""
Everyone who comes into Mikey Likes It is greeted like an old friend by Mikey, the owner, who works behind the counter whenever he gets the chance. He interrogates one young man about whether he's staying out of trouble in school. ""I've heard some stories,"" Mikey tells him. He gives another a high-five when he tells Mikey he's got straight As in school.
""You know if you keep those up, you can bring your report card here at the end of the year and get some free ice cream, right?"" Mikey asks. The young man nods, telling Mikey he'll be back for a free scoop. ""That's what I like to hear!""
Mikey Cole never planned on being an ice cream man. But when he was arrested, his entire life changed.
""I spent six months in Rikers,"" he says, referring to New York City's massive prison complex on Rikers Island. ""Marijuana possession with intent to sell. It was a dark time in my life. I'm not proud of it.""
When Mikey was released—""on good behavior, with eight years probation,"" he adds, smiling—he had a difficult time getting back on his feet.
""I couldn't get a job. Every job application has this little box that you have to check if you've ever been incarcerated. And I know when I check that box, that's it. I'm not getting that job. One day I stopped and said,??why don't I just start my own business and do this on my own?'""
Mikey was one of the millions of former prisoners who are closed off from opportunities by ""the box.""
When former prisoners try to re-enter the job market, many discover a new hurdle: Job applications will often require them to check a box disclosing that they have criminal record. And sometimes, job applicants that check that box are automatically written off by employers.
""The box"" creates a huge barrier to reentry for former prisoners—and not just because of the effect it has on employment: the box appears on many housing applications, too, making it difficult for some former inmates to even find a place to live.
For the African American community, who face being held back because of racial discrimination in the job market, barriers like ""the box"" can have devastating consequences.
The unemployment rate for African Americans is double the rate for white Americans—and has been for quite some time. And an African American college graduate without a criminal record has the same employment prospects as a white high-school dropout, or a white person with a prison record, according to a 2014 study by the Young Invincibles, a nonpartisan education and economic opportunity advocacy group.
And even though African Americans make up about 13 percent of the U.S. population, 37 percent of the male prison population is black and black women are incarcerated at twice the rate of white women.
That means black men like Mikey, who live at the intersection of being both African American and formerly incarcerated, are at a steep disadvantage when seeking employment.
Eventually, Mikey became so fed up with being turned down for job after job that he decided to go around it?by starting his own business.
After discovering a family recipe for vanilla ice cream, Mikey handed out samples to his friends and neighbors. When they told him that the ice cream was good—really good—he decided to start selling it out of his apartment. It was an instant success, and before long, Mikey didn't have to worry about being turned down for jobs.
Mikey Likes It has been incredibly successful. But Mikey's story is far from the norm. Because of the many barriers they face, such as housing and employment discrimination, many former prisoners have an extremely difficult time transitioning back to their lives. Mikey wants to use his business to help people who find themselves in the same position he was once in.
""I want to put Mikey Likes It in prison towns and work with the system and the halfway houses so that, while people are getting rehabilitated, they can work in my ice cream shops. That way, when they go home, they've got something on their resume, so that little box doesn't hold them back so much.""
But Mikey knows that even though he can help some people, he can't fix our broken criminal justice system alone—that's why he's supporting Hillary Clinton.
Hillary is committed to breaking down barriers for every American, and has proposed policies to make sure former prisoners are given the second chance they deserve. Her criminal justice reform agenda includes ""banning the box,"" so that people applying for jobs with the federal government and federal contractors will be able to demonstrate their qualifications before they're asked about their records, and creating initiatives that help former prisoners get back on their feet once they're released.
Mikey believes that Hillary has the best, most comprehensive plan to help people like him return to their lives after being released from prison.
""Talking about the issues that get to people once they're out, to me, shows that she really understands it. She gets that we have to make sure people are able to live productive lives once they're released,"" Mikey says. ""That's huge.""
Hillary's plan also addresses the issues former prisoners face that aren't talked about often, such as state laws that prohibit former prisoners from voting.
""She's been speaking out about giving the right to vote back to us, and that's so important to me. It's not something you see people talk about often.""
Mikey wanted to do something to support Hillary, so—in true Mikey Cole fashion?he created an ice cream sundae just for her: The Mac Daddy Victory.
Mikey's tribute to Hillary is a twist on his classic ""Mac Daddy"" sundae: Chocolate ice cream, chocolate chips, and chocolate marshmallows, sandwiched between two chocolate waffles (with crushed Oreos mixed into the waffle batter), topped with chocolate whipped cream and a chocolate drizzle and finished with a chocolate-covered cherry.
He plans to spend the next year advertising the Mac Daddy Victory as a way to get out the vote for Hillary, and believes advertising the sundae will give him an opportunity to tell his customers how Hillary will break down barriers in for people in his community.

Hillary took Karla into her arms, and told her she was going to do everything in her power to make sure that Karla would never have to worry about being separated from her parents.

Hillary is committed to fighting for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full and equal citizenship ...

Last summer, Sandra Bland lost her life in police custody.
She was a 28-year-old, college-educated woman, getting ready to start a new job. She died alone in a jail cell, three days after she was pulled over and arrested for failing to signal when changing lanes—despite the fact that she never broke the law.
Sandra's death reinforced the dangerous reality of systemic racism and its effect on our criminal justice system. In the weeks and months since, people all over the country have come together to demand justice for Sandra Bland and every other black person who has lost his or her life to police violence.
One of those people is Sandra's mother, Geneva Reed-Veal.
Geneva has channeled her grief over her daughter's senseless death into action, and joined other mothers who have lost their children to violence in fighting to fix the system. And yesterday, Geneva endorsed Hillary Clinton—because she knows that Hillary will fight to make sure that no mother ever has to experience what she did.

When Geneva and Hillary took the stage for an event in Chicago, Geneva let the audience know that she wasn't going to give Hillary the usual introduction.
""So, I'm gonna do something a little non-traditional. I'm not gonna speech it out to you guys,"" Geneva said. ""I created this just for her."" Then, she began to read.
Now is the time, this is the place,
Now we are ready. Hillary is the face.
Why am I endorsing this woman to my right?
Because she has for years continuously put up the fight.
She seeks to make equal pay for equal work a priority.
I don't know about you, but that sure works for me!
Here's a woman who has shown time and time again,
She has the skill, experience and staying power more than 20 years in.
Yes, there was Benghazi and the infamous email situation.
While both were stressful, she maintained her poise and dedication.
Dedicated to seeing mothers who singlehandedly raise babies
Finally get compensated equal pay in this world that has gone crazy.
Selfless in sitting down with a room of mourning mothers,
Who have violently lost their children—both sons and daughters.
Now this I know to be absolutely true;
I am one of those who met with her and was able to make it through.
She has a plan on gun laws that's like none other.
Unapologetically she speaks out about the NRA and issues of color.
Her plan for immigration is to keep families together.
She'll end family detention and close private immigration shelters.
She supports the bipartisan U.S.A. Freedom Act.
President Obama signed it into law, and she has his back!
She has fought for quality affordable health care her entire career.
So she'll defend the Affordable Care Act and build on the successes of it here.
She'll cut taxes for the middle class, raise the minimum wage, and ensure the wealthiest pay their fair share.
She'll invest in infrastructure and education. This woman really cares.
I've watched and followed her career, and saw her take hits.
Yet she still manages to stand here decades later as if it didn't bother her one bit!
As Sandra Bland's mother, I know a little about frustration.
You have to stand and push through it, even when you want a vacation.
Like me, she misses the counsel of her late father, who told her always ""carry a shovel,""
So at any given time she could dig herself out of trouble.
Like me, she lost her dad in 1993.
His wisdom played a big part in the strength she shows you and me.
I've shared with you just some of Hillary's views,
Now it's up to you to do your research—and vote when you're through.
People, we are expecting a new president in nine months. Hillary is that new baby.
From now until November let's fiercely support this lady!

In a speech in Harlem on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton laid out a plan to address systemic racism and expand opportunity for African Americans. She outlined a range of proposals—including ending the era of mass incarceration, protecting the right to vote, and revitalizing communities that have been left out or left behind.
Hillary's record as an elected official speaks volumes about her commitment to racial justice.
Here's how she fought to break down barriers for the African American community as senator from New York.
Protecting the right to vote.
1. She introduced a bill to make it easier for every American to vote and know that their vote would count. The New York Times called her legislation the ""gold standard for election reform"" that would ""strike a blow against vote suppression.""
2. She worked to restore voting rights for those who had been convicted of a crime and served their sentences.
Reforming the criminal justice system.
3. She co-sponsored legislation to eliminate the unjust sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine.
4. She fought to ban racial profiling and to help people re-enter society after being incarcerated.
5. She worked to reform the juvenile justice system and help at-risk youth access mental health and substance abuse treatment and other delinquency prevention services.
Working to end gun violence.
6. She co-sponsored legislation to require criminal background checks on purchases at gun shows and all events that sell firearms.
7. She co-sponsored legislation to extend and reinstate the assault weapons ban.
8. She voted against legislation that shields gun manufacturers and dealers from legal accountability when they endanger Americans—a bill the NRA called ""the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in 20 years.""
Protecting the health of families in underserved communities.
9. She introduced a bill to address the disproportionate impact of environmental pollution on communities of color and a bill to keep families in public housing safe from lead poisoning.
10. She worked with then-Senator Barack Obama on legislation to keep kids safe from lead poisoning at child care facilities.
11. She introduced legislation to create a new fund that would address health disparities for people of color.
Expanding access to education.
12. She worked to expand and improve pre-K programs nationwide.
13. She introduced a bill?to give historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) grants that would help underrepresented students enter health professions.
Preserving and expanding affordable housing.
14. She?introduced legislation?to create a $1 billion fund to help people avoid foreclosure, build subsidized rental housing, and support nonprofit housing developers.
15. She defended Community Development Block Grants—which help local governments create affordable housing and public services—when President Bush tried to eliminate them from the budget.
Creating economic opportunity.
16. She co-sponsored or introduced bills to raise the minimum wage in every full session she served in Congress.
17. She fought for legislation that would ensure the Small Business Administration was providing services to minority-owned businesses.
And she's not finished yet.

Hillary Clinton's campaign in Nevada has been built on one simple idea.

For the past 10 months, organizers have been knocking on doors, making phone calls, and pouring everything into making sure Nevadans caucus for Hillary—and inspiring everyone around them to work harder than ever before.

And when it gets tough, they keep each other going.
""When I think ?I'm so tired,' I think of each and every single one of them, and their commitment to this campaign,"" Emmy says.


""Or Omar,"" she says, ""who is growing up Muslim in this country and who needs someone who's going to fight for his community.""
""Or our precinct captain, Donna. Donna works so hard. She's in our offices every day.""

And when Donna got a chance to meet Hillary, she shared one of the reasons she's working so hard.
""Donna was telling her that her grandkids had autism,"" Emmy says.


For the last 10 months, Hillary has heard from Nevadans from all walks of life—and learned from them.
""Here's somebody who's really taken the time not just to listen, to study up and learn about everything from autism to national security to Alzheimer's to substance abuse to the issues that affect Nevada.""

Today, several families of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shooting are in court, waiting to hear whether their lawsuit against Bushmaster—the company that manufactured the military-style gun used to kill their loved ones—can go forward.
The chances are slim.
That's because the gun industry has a unique legal protection, thanks to their allies in Congress.
Under a law passed by a Republican-controlled Congress in 2005, victims of gun violence cannot legally hold irresponsible gun dealers or manufacturers accountable in most cases where their actions endanger Americans.
Here's what that means: In the United States, you can sue a toy company for making an unsafe teddy bear—but it's nearly impossible to sue a company that manufactured an assault rifle used to kill a classroom of elementary school students.
And the family of one of the victims of the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting was legally blocked from suing an online gun dealer that sold 4,000 rounds of ammunition to the shooter without checking his driver's license. In fact, since the law was passed, nearly every lawsuit filed against gun manufacturers has been dismissed.
The executive vice president of the NRA, Wayne LaPierre, has called the immunity law ""the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in 20 years.""
This law, which has been on the books for more than 10 years, is a startling example of what's at stake in this election. Because if you agree with President Obama that we need a president who will stand up to the gun lobby, the choice is clear.
Hillary Clinton (and then-Senator Obama) stood up to the gun lobby and voted against shielding firearms manufacturers and dealers from legal liability.
Bernie Sanders voted with the gun lobby. In fact, he did it twice: once in 2005, and once in 2003.
Senator Sanders's votes to give the gun lobby legal immunity are even more puzzling when you consider this: He voted to reject that same immunity for fast-food restaurants and five other industries.
The law that lets gun manufacturers and dealers act without consequence should be overturned. There's only one candidate in this race who has what it takes to do that.
Even now, Senator Sanders says he doesn't regret the vote.
Hillary has had a more straightforward solution for over a decade: Repeal the bill entirely and hold the gun industry accountable.
Ending the gun industry's legal immunity is an important step in tackling the epidemic of gun violence in this country.
For Hillary, that's not just talk: She's been standing up to the gun lobby for years. As Wayne LaPierre, CEO and executive vice president of the NRA, puts it:?
And when it really mattered, Senator Sanders stood with them.

Tens of millions of votes will be cast during the 2016 presidential election.
And behind the vote totals, the margins of victory, and the delegate counts are the individual votes themselves. Each one of those votes tells a story. A vote represents a person's beliefs, concerns, hopes, and dreams for the future—and every person has his or her own journey to the ballot box.
Here are just a few of the stories behind the votes that will be cast for Hillary Clinton.
Romane Paul
27 years old
Union, New Jersey
Student at Columbia Law School
What did you do before you started law school?
I taught in Harlem. That job showed me the horrifying reality of the school-to-prison pipeline. We are on the verge of entering a world where we have the most unequal generation ever—and I am not talking about income inequality. I am talking about unequal in terms of opportunity for kids. And this inequality is sickening when you look at it from a racial perspective, because it appears to me that black kids are being automatically set up to be fed through this pipeline—which sets them up for lifelong inequality.
What did the school-to-prison pipeline look like to you, as a teacher?
Before I started teaching, I never understood what the school-to-prison pipeline even meant. But I had one student who was incredibly intelligent, and I sort of saw it through him. A lot of what happened to him has to do with the structural inequalities that are in place in our laws, policies, and communities in general. But part of it is that black boys are not being educated in the same way that their peers are. I felt like the structures that were in place were resistant to African American male success. Everything was designed to prevent success, even in the educational system. And community programs are doing great work—but it's not enough with an issue like this. In order to successfully address this issue, you need a leader in the White House who is familiar with the issue and is willing to tackle these sorts of issues with policy.
Is that why you're supporting Hillary?
It's absolutely a big part of why. I know that this is an issue that she cares about. She has worked on these issues, and she's demonstrated that she has a familiarity with these issues that no other candidate has—on the Republican side or the Democratic side. I care about these issues because I have seen it first hand. I have seen what it does to communities. And so has she. She has that knowledge. When you have a generation of black men that are being incarcerated and are barely making it through school because they are going through the prison system first, that is affecting the black families, and that is in turn affecting the productivity of this country. That is something we need to address immediately. I think she is the best to do it.
Shane Grannum
22 years old
Herndon, Virginia
Student at Columbia Law School?
Why did you decide to go to law school??
I am a first-generation American. I am a first-generation college student. I am the first person in my family to go to law school. I'm particularly very interested in voting rights and campaign finance reform. These two issues have really framed both why I have wanted to go to law school, and why I want to help people after. I believe law school is a place where I can impact a lot of change in these areas. I don't have to look a certain way to do it. I don't have to come from a certain background to do it. I can really achieve my dreams.?
Was there anything Hillary talked about during her speech on breaking down barriers for African Americans that surprised you??
When she acknowledged white privilege towards the end of the speech, I was very surprised by that. I don't think people would expect something like that from a major presidential candidate. I was very satisfied to come out of that speech knowing that's where she was, in terms of fully acknowledging both her privilege and white privilege. And not just as something that might exist, but something that we have to talk about in our society if we hope to make progress at achieving racial justice.?
Why was that important to you?
It demonstrated that this is not something she started caring about yesterday. This is something that she has been fighting for for years. Seeing her here in Harlem talking about white privilege really reiterated for me that this has been part of a decades-long commitment to fighting for racial justice. Specifically, she speaks with the community, and actually listens to find out what the issues are that we care about and hope our president will solve. I think that this speech, in particular, and that moment in acknowledging white privilege, was the product of years of listening to the black community, hearing our concerns and hopes for America, and the visions that we have of a more equal society. For me, I respect that a lot. It shows that she is not just a doer but also a listener.
Marg Powell
Retired librarian
79 years old
Des Moines, Iowa
Why do you support Hillary?
Well, I've always supported her, but something I love about her, which I just recently found out, is that when she was very young, she worked with Marian Wright Edelman [founder of the Children's Defense Fund]. So I did some research, and I found out that even as a fresh college graduate, she was very much involved in doing things for children. When she was just out of undergrad, ""separate but equal"" had been outlawed, but ""segregation academies"" were still around in the South. So, in order to investigate these kinds of schools, she went to the South and pretended to be a mother who was interested in enrolling her children in a school that didn't allow black children. I love that so much. That takes a lot of chutzpah to do, especially at that age. And that shows you her mindset. She's always been like this. She's always wanted to help people.
What issue is most important to you?
The inequity that we experience as black Americans, especially when it comes to being arrested. Iowa has a really high rate of black young men incarcerated. We need to do something about that. I believe that Hillary will. And I believe that she has the right approach to fixing this, because it is a complicated issue. You can't right this wrong in a year. It didn't take a year for this to happen, and it's going to take some time for us to straighten it out correctly. These are complex issues, and I like that she is a person who sees all parts of the problem and tries to work on each one. That means a lot to me.
Why do you think Hillary would make a great president?
So, I've never understood the impulse that makes some people want to be president. You couldn't pay me enough. It seems like such a thankless job. But with her, I get it. I see her, and I see that she wants to get in there and help as many people as humanly possible, and she knows that as president, she will. That selflessness, to me, it what makes her the most qualified, especially when you put it on top of all of her experience. She's not only ready, but she wants the job for the right reasons.
Josh Hughes
School district board member
18 years old
New Virginia, Iowa
Have you ever met Hillary?
I have! I got to meet her about a week before the caucuses, and it was amazing. When I met her, I told her that she gave a speech that inspired me to run for school board in my district. And she lit up! She squeezed my hand, and she asked me, ""How did it go?"" I told her, ""I won!"" She said, ""I'm so proud of you, that's incredible!"" This woman, who is so accomplished and has done so much, told me that she's proud of me. That's insane. And it was genuine! I know it's not the popular opinion—that she's a real person with feelings and emotions—but when I was talking to her, I felt like we were the only people in that room.
What was it about her speech that inspired you?
During that speech, she talked about the importance of electing Democrats on every single level—city, state, federal, all of it—and she was so passionate about democracy and politics really being local and being something that you have to involve yourself in. And she used that John Wesley quote: ""Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can."" That really spoke to me. I had been considering doing something for a while, and that was the push I needed.
Why are you supporting Hillary?
We have made so much progress as a nation recently. And it's not abstract progress—it's progress that helps everyday families in a very tangible way. But that progress is not secure. It's very tenuous, and it could all be undone in an instant. I believe that Hillary can truly protect our progress. Not just because she's a strong, smart woman—which she is, obviously—but because, after meeting her, I know that she's the kind of person who can get things done. She's so genuine—and she cares so much about people—that I know she will do everything she can to help everyone she can. I believe in her.
Izaah Knox (and Porter)
39 years old (and 3 years old)
Des Moines, Iowa
What's your daughter like?
Porter is my youngest—I also have a son who's 13. She is, as my wife would say, the most thoughtful, caring, and sweet little girl; but actually, she absolutely has a streak of independence and decisiveness in her. She loves superheroes over Barbies—she puts her Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in her backpack right along with her Barbies, and the Ninja Turtles all live in her Barbie house.
What do you worry about the most?
I worry about children. I worry about mine, of course—but I worry about all the other children who don't have the access or the opportunity that my children do. Fifty percent of the households in my community make less than $30,000 a year. When I go into the high school, and I offer the students an opportunity for employment at one of the major employers in Des Moines, and they don't even know where that employer's located, that scares me. If we don't open these doors, they'll never even know that the doors exist for them to walk through.
If your daughter were to ask you why you're supporting Hillary, what would you tell her?
I've been in Des Moines for the last 16 years, so I was here to witness what Iowa did for Barack Obama. And, having a son who is a black male, I can now look him in the eyes and tell him that honestly, with hard work and dedication, he can become president of the United States. And with Secretary Clinton, when she wins, I will be able to look my daughter in the eyes and tell her the same thing. That's why I'm doing this—for her.
Scott Thompson
Research assistant
54 years old
Des Moines, Iowa
Have you always been a Democrat?
I was born and raised a Republican. I don't know that I ever put a lot of thought into it. In 2008, I lost my job. And I know that didn't happen because of George W. Bush. It wasn't a political issue, it was just economics, and I paid the price for it. I wasn't able to get another job for 19 months, and in those 19 months I applied to 412 jobs. At that time, I was a devoted Fox News follower, and here's Steve King, our great congressman from northwest Iowa, and Jon Kyl, who was a senator from Arizona, telling people that the long-term unemployed were lazy, and we were a drain on the economy. I knew that was a lie. I wasn't lazy. But those lawmakers didn't want to understand this issue. They wanted to cast doubt and divide people, because that was politically expedient for them. And that was when I realized that the party I grew up with had left me. So in 2008 I became a Democrat, because from what I saw, the Republican Party just completely walked away from their social responsibility—but Democrats were there, and they were ready to actually help people.
When did you first begin supporting Hillary?
Oh, I'll never forget it. It was 2008, and she was at a town hall. Someone asked her a very simple question: ""How do you do it?"" Before this, my wife had always been an avid Hillary Clinton supporter, and I was not. But her answer to that question, which was very real and genuine—that got my attention. And I started looking at Hillary Clinton in a much different light. You could tell that this person had put everything she had into this race. And it was very meaningful to her. She was giving it everything she had. She could have easily said, ""I've had enough. I can't do this anymore."" But she didn't. She stuck it out. Which should have proved to anybody: This is a very tough human being.
Have you ever met her?
We met her at the Iowa fairgrounds. And it was awesome. The minute she hit the room, the room changed. She had a big smile. She was happy to see everybody. She doesn't overtake the room, she works right into the room. Her presence is with you. Not above you, not at you, but with you. It was a fantastic opportunity. And you know what's great? When you get to talk to her, even for a minute, she will stop, and she will look you dead square in the eye and talk to you. There can be three, five hundred people around you, and that conversation is one-on-one. That's an amazing thing.
Sanjita Pradhan
Advocate for the Asian-American community
West Des Moines, Iowa
What do you worry about most often?
The injustice and inequalities that refugees have to deal with in our society. I've worked very closely with refugees in the past. The refugee resettlement system has been around a very long time, but it hasn't changed for the better in a while. I feel—and every refugee feels—grateful for the fact that we've received a second chance at life by getting to come here. But it's kind of an assembly-line system, where it's in and out, in and out. I think, when you're dealing with human life, that's not fair.
And I want to add: Being a first-generation immigrant, I feel like I deal with different kinds of biases and discriminations every day, in many ways. I worry about my kids being able to integrate well in the community and that they will be accepted equally.
Why are you supporting Hillary?
I am a great supporter of President Obama, and I feel like she is the only person who will continue the great work that he has started and build on his legacy. And Hillary's and my values are similar. Being a diverse community member, from a diverse background, I feel like she understands me and people like me, and she's supportive of our issues.
Why do you think Hillary would make a great president?
She sees injustice. She sees a system that she can help make better. I relate to that. I appreciate her fighting for us, for the right things. I'm from Nepal. Nepal is in a very dire situation right now, and the U.S. government is not taking any stance on helping. I think someone like her—who is more aware about the different countries and has experience internationally—can really do something to help us. It's very lofty thinking, but I'm hopeful.
Chris Diebel
Soon-to-be restaurant owner
35 years old
Des Moines, Iowa
What are you worried about right now?
I'm opening a business this summer, and I think about that pretty much 24/7. It's a big undertaking. I'm 35 years old, and my business partners and I are taking on a lot to do a 5,300-square-foot restaurant. Any time you do something creative, you wonder how people will react to it, and you hope everyone will like it. The build-up was very fun, but it's all just on paper until it opens. And then it's real. I worry about how we'll do.
Do you remember the moment you became a fan of Hillary?
Yes: When Barack Obama chose Hillary Clinton to be secretary of state. She handled that so brilliantly. She worked harder than anybody I can remember in that position. She really, truly, was the ultimate ambassador for our country. And the truth is that she's been fighting for our country for her whole career—but I don't think that has ever shined brighter than it did during her time as secretary of state.
Why are you supporting Hillary?
Well, obviously, experience is very important in a presidential candidate. You have to have experience to be president. And she does. But for me, that's just the baseline. A president also needs to inspire passion. And in my mind, she's done that. Over the course of her career, she has inspired such a vast group of people, from all sorts of backgrounds. I believe that we should always dream big, but we also need to exist within the political realities of our time, and work to get things done where we can. And she does that, too. So, for me, it's not just about experience and electability—it's the total package.

It breaks up families. ... And we're going to end it.""
Hillary Clinton has vowed to make immigration reform a top priority as president—and last week, she pledged to repeal a law that is tearing immigrant families apart.
The law Hillary was referring to—commonly known as the ""three- and 10-year bar""—restricts undocumented immigrants pursuing a green card based on their family relationships to leave the country for a period of three or 10 years, depending on how long they have been in the United States.
And it forces families—especially those whose members have different citizenship or immigration statuses—into a heartbreaking dilemma: break apart, or stay together and remain in the shadows.
Blanca Gamez's family is one of them. She first told Hillary her story at a roundtable discussion with other DREAMers last May.
Blanca's younger sister is a U.S. citizen, and her father is a legal permanent resident. But her mother is still undocumented—and if she applies for a green card, she'll be separated from her husband and two daughters in the U.S. until she can get permission to come back.
Hillary told Blanca's story at a Democratic town hall in Las Vegas—and promised to end the three- and 10-year bar that is devastating families like hers.
For Blanca and her family, it was a moment of relief.
""I knew she was listening. And I know she's going to go in there and take action and do something to change this,"" she said.
And it confirmed what she'd known since she first met Hillary at the roundtable last spring.
""I went into there thinking this is going to be just a roundtable where we share our stories. But we had an open dialogue with her. We threw every single question to her and she answered all of them. She talked about the topics that are rarely spoken about, like family detention centers, and she was clear about what actions she'll take.""
""And that's exactly why I support her.""

A 21 year old walked into a gun store in West Columbia, South Carolina, to purchase a .45-caliber handgun.
After three business days, the gun was his—legally purchased, despite an arrest record that should have prohibited him from ever owning a deadly weapon.
Two months after that, he used that gun to kill nine Americans in a church in downtown Charleston.
To understand the paradox of how someone technically prohibited from buying a gun could legally buy one, we have to go back to 1993.
That was the year Congress passed the Brady Bill, a law that requires every gun store to run a background check with the FBI before someone can purchase a gun.
It's worked—and it's blocked more than 2.4 million prohibited gun purchases.
But there's a catch.
When the Brady Bill was being debated, the NRA and its allies in Congress managed to squeeze in a loophole:
Senator Bernie Sanders, then in the U.S. House of Representatives, voted for an amendment to to create this loophole—even though he voted against the final Brady Bill.
Without the Charleston loophole in our gun laws, the FBI would have had more time to complete a background check from that South Carolina gun store, and the Charleston shooter wouldn't have been able to buy his gun.
The Charleston shooter isn't the only person who's gotten a gun through this loophole.
More than 90 percent of the time, the results of a criminal background check come back on the spot. But one time in 10, the FBI sees something they want to investigate further. And if that investigation takes more than three business days, the sale can proceed—regardless of a person's criminal record.
That's really bad news:
Sometimes a few words in a gun bill can be a matter of life and death. It's time to close this dangerous and deadly loophole—before the next Charleston takes place.

Her Response Speaks Volumes,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116782,Hillary Clinton,"She's been thinking about this issue for a very long time.
At a student town hall in Nevada, a high school student asked a question that Hillary Clinton has been thinking about for a long time—how can we help veterans who suffer from mental health issues?
Her detailed answer shows how deeply she cares about this issue—and the thoughtful way she would approach it as commander in chief.
She talked about her experience as a senator on the Armed Services Committee, where she worked on health issues like PTSD and traumatic brain injuries.
She's seen the devastating toll of mental health issues up close—she told the audience about a young Army captain she met when she was visiting patients at Walter Reed. He has lost his arm and was newly adjusting to a prosthetic limb.

She emphasized the need to expand mental health screenings and treatments covered by the VA—and help military members get the assistance they need before they transition back into civilian life.
And she elaborated on different treatment options and programs she has seen work for veterans and their families—and stressed the need to treat every individual based on his or her unique needs.

Dear Bethany and Jordan Grace,
I know, I know. You're used to hearing your dad say that as long as you work hard and have faith, nothing is impossible. But sometimes it can be hard to even dream of doing something nobody like you has ever done. Trust me, I know.
Growing up, I never expected to see a politician who looked like me become president. But in 2008, I watched in awe as Barack Obama ascended to the highest political office in the country.
Now, I've always believed in my ability to do whatever I set my mind to. Grandma and Papa did a very good job of instilling that in me, from the time I was your age. But when President Obama took office, I felt like I really could do anything—truly, in a tangible way I could feel in my heart.
Two years later, Columbia elected me as the first African American mayor in the city's history.
I could never have gotten to where I am if people didn't kick down some doors ahead of me. Because of that, I feel a duty to kick down doors for other people.
When I was 29, Governor Hodges appointed me to his cabinet. He gave me the opportunity of a lifetime, and I used my position to lift up voices that weren't being heard.
I worked hard while there to bring as many women as possible onto my staff. At one point we had an all-female staff, and many of those women have gone on to do remarkable things.
I did that for you two. I wanted to do everything I could to make the world a better place for you, even before you were born.
Of course, both of you know women are capable of accomplishing anything. Your mother is the perfect example of that. But sometimes, things you can't control block you from achieving your dreams.
I don't want you girls to have to wait until you're an adult to have the feeling I had in 2008. I want you to grow up knowing—not just believing, but KNOWING—you can be anything you want, even president of the United States.
That's one of the reasons I'm working so hard to get Hillary Clinton elected.
Bethie, getting to watch you talk with Hillary was one of the proudest moments of my life. I will never forget the look on Secretary Clinton's face when you told her guys had been president for long enough, and it was time for women to take control. She called you the smartest 10-year-old in the world, and she was right.
Jojo, I know you haven't met her yet, but don't worry—I'm working on it.
I want both of you girls to grow up in a better, safer, more prosperous country. I know Secretary Clinton can—and will—build that country.
If you study hard, love your family, serve your community, are never afraid to lead, and continue to follow the model of your mother, your grandmothers, and women like Secretary Clinton, nothing should ever stop you from achieving your dreams.
I am doing everything I can to put a woman in the White House because I believe both of you can grow up to be president—and I want you to believe it, too.
Love,
Dad

Now He's Saving Victims of Gun Violence in South Carolina",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116868,Hillary Clinton,"And he's fighting to end the epidemic.
Dr. Joseph Sakran has a special connection to Inova Fairfax Hospital in Fairfax, Virginia. It's where he was born and where he did his surgical residency.
And it's where the ambulance took him after he was shot in the neck at a high school football game.
""I was just hanging out with my friends,"" Joe says, ""and then a fight broke out, and a guy pulled out a gun and starts firing. I got hit with a random bullet.""
The bullet severed an artery—an injury that is usually fatal. Joe knows that he was close to dying that night.
Thankfully, a surgeon was able to repair the artery, saving his life.
Before that night, Joe had no idea what he wanted to do with his life—but afterward, he was set on becoming a doctor.
""I pursued trauma surgery because I felt like I had been given a second opportunity at life, and I want to give other people that same second chance.""
Joe treats gun victims every day at the Medical University of South Carolina, performing the exact kind of operations that kept him alive as a teen.
"" The worst moment for me is when I have to go out and explain to the family that their loved one has just been killed. ... The image of their face is often chiseled into my memory for days. I think of my parents and what they must have gone through when they heard I was shot.""
In addition to saving lives on the operating table, Joe is a passionate advocate for gun violence prevention.
That's why Joe is fighting to help Hillary Clinton get to the White House.
""Over 120,000 people will be killed by guns during the next presidential term of office if we continue our current trend,"" he explains.
"" I don't want to keep operating on children who've been shot.""Dr. Joseph Sakran
""I want these mass shootings to stop. It's not enough to offer condolences after every tragedy. We need someone in office who is truly, completely committed to ending this—and Hillary is the only presidential candidate, Republican or Democrat, who has a record of standing up to the gun lobby and fighting for reforms that will save lives.""

The Republican presidential field has narrowed to four, and a terrifying picture is coming into focus. The handful of remaining candidates all hold the same backward views on LGBT equality, women's rights, health care—and just about everything else.
And each of their records is as bad as the next. Here are just a few highlights from the 2016 Republican lineup:
Introduced a bill that would bar refugees from countries ""with active terrorist presence"" from entering the United States
Voted to block legislation that would let students refinance their federal loans and against a bill to cap interest rates on federal student loans
Led a filibuster in the Senate to stall gun reform after the deadly shooting in Newtown, Connecticut
Repeatedly voted to defund Planned Parenthood
Ohio Governor John Kasich
Defunded Planned Parenthood in Ohio and enacted 16 restrictions on abortion
Signed a union-busting bill that limited the ability of public workers to collectively bargain for better conditions the same week that Governor Scott Walker did the same in Wisconsin
Supported an Ohio constitutional ban on same sex marriage
Signed laws making it harder for Ohioans to vote?
Senator Marco Rubio
Argued that programs like Social Security and Medicare have ""weakened us as a people""
Wants to gut federal highway funding by as much as 80 percent, while phasing out the dedicated mass transit funding that is critical for working Americans
Voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act—a law to help ensure equal pay—and against allowing workers to earn paid sick to specifically address their family's health needs
Voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA)—a bill that would keep people from losing their jobs simply because of their gender identity or sexual orientation
Donald Trump
Wants to ban Muslims from entering the United States
Proposed a $227,000 tax cut for people in the top 1 percent, adding $12 trillion to the deficit
Wants to build a wall between Mexico and the United States and deport 11 million immigrants
Willing to shut down the government to defund Planned Parenthood
No matter who the Republicans choose as their presidential nominee, that person would:
Repeal the Affordable Care Act
Defund Planned Parenthood
Oppose the Wall Street reforms in Dodd-Frank
Give the wealthy huge tax breaks
Oppose executive actions that keep immigrant families together
There's no telling which Republican will emerge as the party nominee, but one thing is clear: We can't let him anywhere near the White House.

In the middle of a live TV town hall from Columbia, South Carolina, Hillary Clinton took a moment to acknowledge five women in the audience.
She explained: ""These five women have lost children to police actions and to random senseless gun violence, and there's no doubt that in each case ... there is a racial component to it.""
Sybrina Fulton's son, Trayvon Martin, was murdered by a man who viewed him as ""dangerous"" because of the color of his skin.
Geneva Reed-Veal's daughter, Sandra Bland, was found hanging in a jail cell after she was pulled over for a routine traffic stop.
Maria Hamilton's son, Dontre Hamilton, was shot 14 times by a Milwaukee police officer.
Gwen Carr's son, Eric Garner, was choked to death by a police officer on the streets of New York.
Lucy McBath's son, Jordan Davis, was killed for playing his music too loudly.
They've come together to take on the issues of gun violence and policing that led to their children's deaths. And they're working hard to elect a president who will take up the fight for real reforms alongside them.
Last November, Hillary Clinton reached out to families who had lost a loved one and invited them to meet in Chicago. Many of the mothers weren't sure what to expect. But what they saw and heard in the meeting stuck with them.
""We poured out our hearts. Where no other candidate would listen to us, Mrs. Clinton did,"" said Sybrina.
In the months since, they've come together as the ""Mothers of the Movement,"" turning their grief over unthinkable tragedy into a powerful call to action.
Most recently, they headed together to South Carolina. In between campaign stops, Geneva, Maria, Lucy, Sybrina, and Gwen sat down to talk about their experiences on the trail.
Q. What have these last few days been like for you?
Sybrina: We have been extremely busy, but it was with a purpose. We went to a lot of churches, and people showed their support by coming out. They could've been doing anything, but they decided to come listen to what we had to say and why we're endorsing Hillary Clinton. We think we're making a difference.
Geneva: You talk about family, I feel like we're really family. And so this experience has brought us closer. Outside of endorsing Hillary, outside of meeting at these functions, this has really allowed me to see that we are anchored in our faith. And so it's wonderful when you're in like company, and you understand what your purpose is, and you're able to move in that purpose—even beyond the pain.
Sybrina: It's a different kind of pain when you lose a child. These mothers can say, ""I know how you feel,"" and actually know how we feel, how we're still carrying the hurt and the pain around with us every single day. People don't see that often. There's a lot of disappointment, a lot of sadness, a lot of hurt, a lot of pain that we carry around on a daily basis, and it makes it just that much lighter to know that I'm going through this journey—and I got other mothers that are standing with me. I don't wish this on anybody, but if I had to pick somebody, this would be the group that I would pick to go through it with me. Women that, when I'm hurting and I'm in pain, can give me a word. Women that I can give a word to, and they understand that.
Lucy: We're deeply and morally grounded in faith. And that has a lot to do with the reasons why we have been allowed to go through these tragedies—because we understand dynamically that this is just not about our babies, and God has a bigger purpose in what he's doing through us. And so we're taking this to the streets. We know through faith that this is the way we change the course of what's happening in the country. Through faith, we'll be able to make sure that Secretary Clinton becomes the next president of the United States. We will help usher in just a whole new kind of history. We're going to be a part of that—and our children have been the catalyst for that. For us, it's not just being here on the campaign trail. It's much deeper than that.
Maria: We're still hurting. And we know that our children deserved to have somebody fight for them. So we're their voice. They can't fight for themselves. That was stripped away from them. So we want everybody to know .... that we love our children.
Gwen:?And when we talk to the people, we preach. They look at us, and they tell us how strong we are—but we don't look like what we've been through. We've been through a lot. We're going through a lot, and we have a lot to go through!
Maria:?Yes!
Gwen:?We know there's a lot of work to do. And we're the ones to do it. And—as I promised my son—I will walk, rally. I will stand up and hold up his name and the names of the nameless and the forgotten, because we all hurt.
Maria:?When this journey is over with this campaign, we still have to go forward. We have to still continue to fight. And with us getting to know each other, us learning each other's strengths, this will help us to go forward in our personal lives—as well as in a group environment.
Q. Why did you decide to support Hillary Clinton?
Maria: We endorsed her because she endorsed us.
Gwen: She came to us and she was concerned about our pain.
Sybrina: She showed us support and concern about what we were going through. No one stepped out of the political arena to do that. None of the candidates reached out to us. When they had their presidential debates, no one spoke about Black Lives Matter. No one spoke about senseless gun violence and how many African Americans were being killed and how no one was being held accountable for it. She supported us before we even supported her.
Maria: She reached out to each one of us individually.
Sybrina: Twelve families were in that private meeting [in Chicago].
Q. What is it like to see so many parents bringing their children to your events?
Lucy: I think we offer a sense of hope for them, because in our communities there's a tremendous sense of hopelessness. We're watching our babies being gunned down in the street, our loved ones and family members being gunned down in the street. And then they're like, ""Where do we turn? What do we do?"" The laws aren't supporting us. The criminal justice system isn't supporting us. There's nobody supporting us. So for them to be able to see that we stood through the loss of our babies—and we're still standing and moving forward and fighting on their behalf—I think that really gives them a sense of hope.
Lucy: And I think our concern has been that everyone waits for the national election to go out and vote. But it starts at the primaries. You can't wait until the presidential election comes, because then it's too late. We're aiming to move people that may not have gone to the polls. We're trying to be proactive.
Gwen: I think we were able to make people aware of how important it is to get out there and vote. And I think they see that. They get it!
Q. If you could tell the whole world one thing, what would that be?
Sybrina: If I could tell the world one thing, I would tell them to never give up. Never give up!
Maria: I'm hurt but I'm not broke.
Geneva: I would tell them that our children have gone on, but we're still here—and we're still speaking for them!
Gwen: I would tell them that I am a mother that's going to fight for justice as long as there's breath in my body.
Lucy: I'd say that we've been a broken people, but we still rise!
Geneva: Amen!

Hillary Clinton recently went to Morris College—a historically black college in Sumter, South Carolina—to talk with students and community members about her plan for debt-free college tuition.
Before she spoke, Hillary met with a few students backstage. They discussed the high cost of college, the crisis of student debt in America, and the unique challenges facing students at historically black colleges and universities.
Here's what the students thought of their conversation.
Karel Gass
21 years old
Sophomore political science major, Morris College
Sumter, South Carolina
You got to meet Hillary before her event at your school. What did you talk about with her?
She asked if any of us knew our interest rates for the loans we had taken out to come to school. And I told her that my combined rate is 13 percent, because I had to take out $10,000 dollars for just one semester. She was genuinely shocked—my interest rate was the highest she's ever heard. She was clearly, genuinely upset. And she talked how her plans would fix things like this, and better accommodate myself and other students who are dealing with student loans and debt in the future.
Did meeting Hillary change your opinion of her?
Well, she's had my vote since day one, but I will admit that at the beginning of this campaign I was kind of like, ""Well, is she genuine? Does she mean what she says? Is she going to follow through?"" But after actually seeing her have a conversation with us, and look us in the eyes, and be genuine, and feel for us, I really believe in all of the ideas and everything that she's going to put into place. I feel like, having met her one-on-one, I want to go out of my way to support her and help get her ideas and messages out there, so more people can understand why this woman should be the next president of the United States.
What would you tell a young South Carolinian voter who's still undecided?
I would tell young voters who feel like their vote doesn't matter in this primary, because we live in a red state, that your vote absolutely does matter. And we have the power to change the politics of our state by voting for someone who is genuine and who is for us, both as young people and as a state.
Levar Kemp
28 years old
Sophomore mass communication major, Morris College
Sumter, South Carolina
Why did you decide to attend Morris College?
I come from a line of HBCU graduates. My family all went to different HBCUs—FAMU, Howard, and some of the smaller ones like Vorhees and Benedict. And I wanted to continue the tradition. So I decided to come to Morris for my undergraduate education, and then after I graduate, I will do my masters at another HBCU, Howard University.
You got to meet Hillary before her event at your school. What did you talk about with her?
In the meeting, when she came in, what caught me was how she automatically started talking about student debt, which was actually what I was going to ask her about—the student debt HBCU students deal with. I wanted to know what her thoughts were on it, and if she was going to have any plans behind those thoughts. And basically, she nailed everything about it right when I met her. So that threw me off because I was gonna ask her the question.
Did meeting Hillary change your opinion of her?
I'd say I've gone from supporting her because she's the most qualified to supporting her because I know how much she cares. I stood right in front of her, and saw her address important issues genuinely and that she really does care. I feel more comfortable with voting for her, yeah. So, since I've now had a personal conversation with her, I know for sure how genuine she is.
Moses Pyatt
23 years old
Junior political science major, Morris College
Charleston, South Carolina
Why are you majoring in political science?
I've always liked campaigns. I have always been fascinated by the ways in which people get support and votes. But, more recently, I became interested in the governing side of things—the processes and work that go into that. I think that's actually what pushed me to major in political science, because that's so interesting. Now I want to go into politics, hopefully. Maybe.
What was it like meeting Hillary?
A little surreal. I wanted to talk to her about college affordability, specifically in the context of HBCUs—what kind of funding would she provide, what kind of programs is she interested in creating. And she answered that question. Thoroughly. And just from being in a room with her and speaking to her ... I was already a fan of her, but now I'm an even bigger fan. Meeting her showed the true compassion that she has. She cares about us—we could all tell. That makes me feel great, because that is my candidate, and now I know how much she cares. Also, I was surprised at how short she is. That was unexpected.
What would you tell a young South Carolinian voter who's still undecided?
I would tell them that there is a serious candidate out there, and she needs your support. This is a serious election. Too much is at stake for us to not participate. We can't go back. We need to continue to go forward. A vote for Hillary is a vote for forward progress.
Jake Sanders III
20 years old
Junior Christian education major, Morris College
Sumter, South Carolina
Why did you decide to attend Morris College?
I actually had every intention of going to The Citadel, in Charleston. But my mother and grandmother convinced me to try Morris College. And ever since I came to Morris college, I fell in love with the HBCU experience. I am proud to say that I am currently the junior class president and the university chaplain—and I'm also running for first vice president next year. I wouldn't trade my experience at Morris for the world.
What do you think of Hillary, now that you've met her?
I like the fact that she is so down to earth. I really wasn't expecting that. You know how some people get so high up, they kind of stop being a real person? That's not her at all. She was very down to earth. I liked how she talked to us as human beings, and I really enjoyed her company.
What did you take out of that meeting?
Meeting Hillary has motivated me to promote her even more. And I feel like she's really the candidate for our generation. It's time for us young people to treat ourselves, not cheat ourselves. And we can do that by voting for and supporting Secretary Clinton, because she understands what our needs are and has plans to address them.
Aaron Washington
19 years old
Sophomore criminal justice major, Morris College
Dalzell, South Carolina
Why did you decide to attend Morris College?
I joined the HBCU community because I feel like HBCUs present us with more opportunities than other universities. Schools like Morris, I think, will do more to give us the tools to succeed in a way that other schools can't.
Did you have a question you wanted to ask Hillary during your meeting?
I actually wanted to speak to her about—it's similar to the question my friend Karel was talking about—loan forgiveness. I wanted to know her thoughts on how loan forgiveness would affect our state and federal economy. And she gave a long, detailed answer, which was really good.
Did the meeting change your opinion of Hillary?
I knew I would support her. But after getting to see her face-to-face, you know, she was courageous, had leadership, and she was full of energy. I'm more secure with her being the president, and with the ideas she stands for and her viewpoints. Out of all the candidates I've heard speak, her arguments weren't fake. I know she believes them. She spoke from the heart. She was actually real.

After the South Carolina primary, Hillary Clinton had a message for people across the country: We are in this together—and together, we can break down all the barriers we face.
""When we stand together, there is no barrier too big to break.""
""Tomorrow, this campaign goes national. We are going to compete for every vote in every state. We are not taking anything—and we're not taking anyone—for granted.""
""This campaign—and this victory tonight—is for the parents and teachers in rural South Carolina. They showed me crumbling classrooms in communities too long neglected.""
""This campaign—and our victory—is for the entrepreneur who told me, ?more dreams die in the parking lot of banks than anywhere else.' And that's especially true for women and people of color.""
""Let's break down the barriers that keep people on the sidelines of our economy, especially women.""
""Let's break down the barriers holding back our young people—especially the student debt that makes it hard to imagine ever living the life you want.""
""I want to pay tribute to five extraordinary women who crisscrossed this state with me and for me. Five mothers brought together by tragedy. ... They are reminding us of something deep and powerful in the American spirit.""
""Our country was built by people who had each other's backs. Who understood we all have to do our part—and that, at our best, we all rise together.""
""Imagine a tomorrow where no child grows up in the shadow of discrimination or under the specter of deportation.""
""Imagine a tomorrow where hard work is honored, families are supported, and communities are strong. When we trust and respect each other, despite all that divides us.""
""Imagine what we can build together.""

Today's the big day: It's go time in South Carolina.
We know these primaries are won and lost on voter turnout—so we need to do our part to make sure every last Hillary Clinton supporter in South Carolina gets to the polls today.
The most important thing you can do for Hillary is call a few voters in the Palmetto State. Yes, really.
You don't even need a phone. Just click this link to get started.
It'll go a little something like this: We'll dial up a Hillary supporter in South Carolina. You'll remind them the primary is today and tell them their polling location. (Don't worry, we'll help you with what to say.) They'll thank you, and probably tell you how psyched they are to vote today!
It's really that easy.
If we all make just three calls, we could mobilize tens of thousands of people—and that could make all the difference in this race.
With your help, we can put South Carolina in the win column and keep building our momentum across the country.
So let's get this done for Hillary!

Geneva Reed-Veal
Mother of Sandra Bland
Chicago, Illinois
How did you decide to start traveling around the country, and what are you trying to do?
I have joined together with several other mothers who have lost children. We are the Mothers of the Movement. We have decided that we are going to band together, and we're going to tell the world our personal stories. This movement is about getting up and moving! It's about changing what's going on in our criminal justice system, what's going on with policing in our communities. I know this is what I need to be doing, because there are many people who are so angry with the state of what's going on in the world that they're not going to vote. So I can get out there and say, ""Hey, I'm still standing. Even in the midst of all this grief, I can get up and move, so you can, too."" That's why we say we're Mothers of the Movement. We are moving. We're not parked, we are going. That's it.
What does it feel like to take up this fight alongside other mothers?
You know, when you're a mom and you're grieving and you're missing your child, even after you're done with the crying, you still have to go home and deal with your regular life, which is hard. And so when we get together, it is one of the most powerful things you ever can imagine. We catch up, and we hear what's going on with the legislature in each person's state. And we try to have fun. We try to at least laugh. Because there is a lot of crying sometimes. We keep tissue available. We will talk about our kids, of course, but we also talk about all the things that are going on in the world. And now, with all of us endorsing Hillary, we're in this movement to get her in there. We don't care what we have to do, we're going to do it.
What was it like when you came together in Chicago last November?
Well, first of all, I wasn't even going to go to that meeting. It was one of those days where I woke up, and it was a bad day. I was having a ""Sandy day"" all day. I was crying, and I said, ""I'm not going, ok?"" And then my daughter said, ""What do you mean you're not going? Oh no, we're going."" So I get there, and all the other moms are there, and it's like this big reunion. We just hugged each other. Might not have said a word, but we just hugged each other and you could feel that energy. Then Hillary Clinton comes in, she sits down. And immediately it was like she's at our kitchen table. There was this overwhelming sense that this is family. She said, ""I'm honored to be here with you guys. Tell me about your daughter, your son."" And we were like, ""My God."" She took her time and listened to each one of us around the table. And then, around the end of the meeting, she said, ""You guys really need to unify."" And that's what we did. Then she said, ""I will be getting back with you."" And to talk with all the ladies and find out that's literally what she did—you can't fake that. That's not phony. We're just rolling with Hillary. Period.
Sybrina Fulton
Mother of Trayvon Martin
Miami, Florida
What is like to be a ""Mother of the Movement""?
Well, I guess you can call me an unwilling participant. I don't think any of the mothers that I come to the table with want to be on that side of the table. I would not have signed up for this, I would not have trained for this. This is something that happens in your life and you feel like, ""I have to do something about it. I can't just continue to be broken. I must do my part."" And so this is me doing my part, not only for my son who's in heaven but for my son who's here on earth, too. I'll always have two boys. But I will continue to do the work to try to fight against senseless gun violence. I will try to do what I can, and I'm dedicated to this fight. I can't help Trayvon at this time. But there are other Trayvon Martins who I can help. And working with these mothers is one way I can do that.
What was it like when you first sat down with the other mothers in Chicago?
It was a very heartfelt meeting. It was supposed to be pretty short in the beginning, but because of the topics and the tragedies and the things that were being discussed, Secretary Clinton wanted to hear more. The meeting was very productive on our end as mothers. But it was also an eye opener for Secretary Clinton, because now, not only did she hear about these tragedies in the news and on social media and from her staffers, she heard first-hand from the mothers. And she's a mother. She's a grandmother. She's a wife. She's a woman. She related to us at a time when nobody else would listen. She made no promises about, ""I'll do this and I'll do that if I'm elected."" What she did commit to do was put every effort into making sure that this does not happen to anybody else's kid. She wanted to make sure that she put the proper laws and policies in place to try to make a difference. And that was important to us as mothers.
Why did you decide to come to South Carolina?
We are having a crisis in the United States. Hillary Clinton has stepped out and is discussing this, because she knows it is a huge problem in our community. She addressed the issue—and that meant a lot to us. Her experience and her leadership speaks for itself. Her information and how she deals with equality for women, for minorities—it speaks for itself. I tell everybody to make sure they're taking a look at the track record of some of these candidates and to make sure they're not just talking the talk. That they have put the work in. Hillary Clinton has put the work in.
Lucia McBath
Mother of Jordan Davis
Jacksonville, Florida
What is it like to travel around the country with other ""Mothers of the Movement""?
It's camaraderie. Just a sense—I kind of hate to say it—but a sense of belonging. Because for us, we are our own circle of mothers. It's very difficult to express what we feel and what we think to people who haven't experienced what we've experienced. People claim, ""Oh, I know how you feel."" No, you don't know. And so to be able to lean on each other, and to support each other, and to nurture each other, is so rewarding. And as we go forward, it may seem like we're very strong—but at the core, we're still pretty weak, because you never get over this. I mean, this is every day of our lives. And so to be in the company of other women—black women—who understand what I'm bearing because they're bearing the same thing, it's comforting. It's so comforting to be embraced by other women who really, really share your pain.
What happened when you came together as a group that first time in Chicago?
It was very powerful. There was just this sense of awe, because I've been watching the cases on television, and I've been watching the women, and I've been listening to their stories and listening to the news. But to actually be in the same company of women who have been so morally injured by the same gun violence, the same implicit bias, that was just ... I looked at Cleo Pendleton, and I said to her, ""You know what? I'm so glad we're together, but it's just so painful why we have to be at this meeting with Secretary Clinton. We shouldn't have to be here for these reasons."" But it was empowering, because during that meeting Secretary Clinton told us, ""I need you, the mothers, to mobilize and move forward in this movement."" And before that, nobody else had really given us permission to really begin to challenge those things that we've suffered. We'd just taken permission, and decided ourselves to do it. But to have someone of the stature of Secretary Clinton back us up, and support us, and ask us to help champion as well, and to know that she's championing for us and our communities, that was huge. It was monumental to me.
Why did you come to South Carolina?
These are moments that are once-in-a-lifetime. She's going to be the first female president of the United States, and she's going to be able to help usher in change through everything that President Obama has already put in place. So to be a part of that history, even this little small part that I get to play, is such a tremendous blessing. So then it makes me know that Jordan and all of our children didn't die in vain. That we're just all a bigger part of God's greater plan. And so to be able to be a part of that, whether she wins or not, I'm grateful.
Maria Hamilton
Mother of Dontre Hamilton
Milwaukee, Wisconsin
After your son was killed, you founded a group called Mothers for Justice. What does that organization do?
Through Mothers for Justice, I provide support to families who are victims of stolen life. I call them stolen lives—I don't call them victims, because they're not victims. The victims are those who are left in the wake of that stolen life, and that's who I help. I get phone calls at three, four in the morning from moms who just can't deal. And I know how they feel. I know their lives will never be the same. So we nurture, we grieve together, we depend on each other. And that's what we get our comfort from. Our joy comes from God.
What has it been like to spend time traveling the country with Geneva, Sybrina, Lucy, and Gwen?
I enjoy being around my sisters. It's been educational. It's empowering, and it's been a spiritual journey. We laugh. We cry. We hold each other up in times of need. We depend on each other for answers. We are companions, and we're supportive of each other's efforts. All of us have our connections with the Lord and what we're doing in this movement, and it's phenomenal. And we keep our children right in the midst of everything we do. We say that our sons are seeds. I feel as though me and my family have been chosen to be a part of this movement because of our faith and God's mercy and his grace. And a lot of the other victims of stolen lives feel the presence of those lives as well. This is my life's work—to get justice for my son, and for those coming.
Why did you come to South Carolina?
Because I believe Hillary Clinton will make the best president. I chose Hillary because of her record, because of her caring spirit, and because she's a listener and she's been involved since we got together. After we first met, she made my struggle for justice her business and her affair. I had a meeting with Hillary at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. I spoke with her for about five minutes. She told me that she was a mother and a grandmother. She was very compassionate. She told me how sorry she was, and that she was going to build her policy in a way that allowed her to do everything in her power to stop things like what happened to us from ever happening again. And right then and there, during the meeting, I knew that I was going to endorse her. I knew that some point in my near future I would be partnering up with her. I didn't know it would be to this extent, but I am able to move forward because of her efforts. I appreciate that. That's why I'm here.
Gwen Carr
Mother of Eric Garner
New York, New York
Why did you become involved with this movement?
My son no longer has a voice, but his mother does. I'm going to get out there, and I'm going to speak out. I'm going to walk, I'm going to rally—whatever it takes—until my voice is heard, until we get justice. As a people, we have to take a stand. And I have to take a stand for my son, as well as for the people who experienced this, but no one knows their stories. Or they were in the news for one day and never talked about again. I'm going to be the voice of the voiceless and the nameless. I'm going to speak out—not only for Eric, but for all the other mothers, sisters, brothers, uncles, and aunts out there. We have to make the world aware of what they are doing to our young men. And if we don't stop it, it's going to continue.
What stands out to you from the first meeting with the mothers and Hillary Clinton?
There were 12 of us mothers in that meeting. Hillary asked each of us to share our stories, and everyone's child had died of gun violence—except for my child. So when it became my turn, she said, before I even spoke, ""Well I know, Ms. Carr, your son didn't die from gun violence."" I said, ""You're right, he was choked to death."" She said, ""There's something we have to do about that, too."" She took that into consideration, that no matter how your son died, it was still violence. And this is what we need our officials to recognize—our hurt and our pain, no matter how it came. It was really impressive to me because she was clearly concerned about my situation.
During your time in South Carolina, you attended service at Macedonia AME Church. How did the sermon that day make you feel?
The sermon was all about stepping outside of the box, and for me, that was a very powerful message. Because I sometimes say the same things to people about stepping outside the box. The box is repetitious. You do the same thing over and over and keep getting the same results, which most of the time are not positive. When you step outside the box, you don't know what you're going to get, but you're taking a leap of faith. A lot of times when you go on faith, you can get more things done, more things will materialize. Sometimes you don't even know how they happen, but they happen. And I step out the box a lot of times. This movement for my son—this is outside the box for me. I never thought that I'd be doing this. I never thought I'd be in South Carolina. I never thought I'd be in Florida, in California. But I've been all these places, and that's outside the box for me.

Want to help Hillary Clinton win today? Time to hop on the phone.
Today's a HUGE day for our campaign—Super Tuesday wins will go a long way toward helping Hillary Clinton secure the nomination.
With 800+ delegates on the line, we've got to do everything we can to get Hillary supporters out there to make their voices heard.
Even in a digital world, the most effective way to make sure our supporters turn out (besides knocking on their doors) is by calling them on the phone—old-school style.
Can you make a few calls for Hillary today? We'll be calling into 11 of the states holding contests—Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia.
You don't even need a phone—you just need to click here.?And don't worry if you've never done this before—we'll walk you through everything you need.

Delegates 101: Why Super Tuesday is so super
Democrats are voting or caucusing today in 12 contests—11 states, plus the territory of American Samoa.
Across these contests, there are more than 800 delegates up for grabs—more than on any other day single day in the presidential primary. For comparison's sake, there were 156 delegates at stake in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina combined.?
What is a delegate, anyway?
Democratic delegates will represent the party at its national convention this summer. When primary voters and caucus-goers go to the polls, they're actually choosing which candidate to pledge delegates to—and the candidate with the majority of delegates at the convention will become the Democratic presidential nominee.
There are 4,051 pledged delegates up for grabs in this year's Democratic primary—with a specific number awarded in every caucus and primary. Delegates in Democratic caucuses and primaries are awarded based on how much support each candidate receives.
Right now—after the first four contests—Hillary Clinton is winning the pledged delegate count with 91 delegates. Senator Bernie Sanders has 65.
So what happens today?
At the end of Super Tuesday, about a quarter of pledged delegates will have been awarded. Here's the breakdown of the delegates at stake today:
We'll be keeping tabs on the delegate count as results come in tonight! Make sure to check back for updates.

Dear Mrs. Clinton,
My daughter, Alexis, is 8 years old. She was born in 2008 to a white mother and African American father, the same year we elected a strong president who looks like her.?
In this election, Alexis is looking forward to another strong president that also looks like her. Alexis is a BIG Hillary Clinton supporter. Although she does not understand all that is at stake during this election, she knows what so many women know: You will be an AMAZING president. ?
When my husband was growing up, his dream was to be the first black president. Although his aspirations went a different direction, I saw the pride in him when this became a reality for President Obama. He accomplished the hopes and dreams of MILLIONS of Americans.
You have this same opportunity. My hope is that my daughter will not have to dream of being the first anything, because that road will have already been paved by strong women like you. You take with you the hopes and dreams of MILLIONS of American women and girls.?
Good luck, and keep up the fight for us all!!!

In an interview with MSNBC, he said that abortion should be illegal—and there would ""have to be some form of punishment"" for women who have an abortion.
When it comes to women's health and rights, the stakes in 2016 could not be higher.
Earlier this month, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a Texas case that could have sweeping implications for women's ability to access safe and legal abortion across the country—not only today, but for generations to come. Here, four women take on the complex issue of abortion, Donald Trump's comments, the potential impact of the Texas case, and the importance of protecting women's health and rights in the upcoming presidential election.
President Donald Trump: the stuff of women's nightmares
By Christina Reynolds, deputy communications director?
I'll cut to the chase: Our next president could fill up to three Supreme Court vacancies. And there's no damn way we can entrust that responsibility to Donald Trump (or any of the other Republican candidates, for that matter).
The stakes are especially high for women if we let one of those guys into office—Trump's outrageous comments are proof of that. In case you missed it, he said abortion should be illegal, and if a woman gets one, ""there has to be some sort of punishment.""
Let me repeat that: Donald Trump wants to punish women for making their own health care decisions.
He also made sure to point out that the only way abortion will be outlawed in America is if we elect a president like him who'll appoint anti-choice judges.
We can't let Donald Trump—or any of the other Republicans—anywhere near the Supreme Court. These Republicans are the most terrifyingly extreme field of candidates I've ever seen—and if one of them wins, they could impose their views on women for decades to come via the justices they'll appoint. Instead of heroes like Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, we could have the next generation of Alitos and Thomases restricting our constitutional rights.
There's only one person who can stop them from winning the White House: Hillary Clinton. Generations of women are counting on her—and counting on us to help elect her. This election is way too important for us to let them down.
Donald Trump's remarks should make America sit up and pay attention
By Mini Timmaraju, women's outreach director?
Before I came to work for Hillary Clinton, I spent close to five years working for Planned Parenthood—a lot of that time in my home state of Texas. That work has had a profound impact on the way I see the stakes in this presidential election.
During his time in office, Governor Perry attacked women's health and Planned Parenthood. He cut funding for preventive care and screenings, and signed laws like the demeaning mandatory ultrasound bill, which forced women seeking an abortion in Texas to undergo a medically unnecessary ultrasound, whether they wanted to or not. And he signed House Bill 2, one of the nation's toughest abortion restrictions—after saying that his ultimate goal was to make access to abortion at any stage ""a thing of the past.""
It's hard to understate the impact of HB 2. Almost immediately after the law took effect, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast was overwhelmed with calls and women lined up outside to try and understand whether they would need to go somewhere else for their appointments. Doris Dixon, a friend and the call center director for Planned Parenthood, shared a heartbreaking account of a woman who traveled from out of state and stayed in Houston overnight, only to learn she could no longer have a procedure that had been legal days before. Doris wrote: ""I don't know what will happen to her. I don't know that I will ever stop thinking about her. And she is just one woman whose life has been turned upside down by this law.""
I thought the assault on women's rights and health care access couldn't get more egregious—or downright offensive. Enter Donald Trump. The Republican frontrunner just called for criminal action against women who have abortions. This is more than horrific rhetoric. It's a shot across the bow.
We've seen firsthand what happens when politicians put up barrier after barrier to stop women from getting the health care they need, and health care providers in an already struggling state are forced to close their doors.
And Donald Trump has made it clear that if he is elected president, what happened in Texas will play out across the country—and the consequences for women in America will be as disastrous as they have been in Texas.
We can't let that happen. This is why we do what we do. This is why we fight. And we need someone in the White House who will take up those fights alongside us.
This is about justice, plain and simple.
By Maya Harris, senior policy advisor
Law and policy aren't abstract issues or cheap campaign fodder. They affect people's lives every day, in big and small ways, for better or worse. And when candidates like Donald Trump call for criminalizing abortion, it matters.
Trump may be leading the race to the bottom when it comes to women's health and rights, but he's far from the only contestant. In the last five years alone, lawmakers across the country have enacted 231 restrictions on abortion. These restrictions put quality, affordable reproductive health care even further out of reach for women who already face the greatest obstacles to getting the care they need. It's a vicious cycle.
At a time when we should be doing everything we can to break down barriers that hold people back and build ladders of opportunity in their place, laws like these build even more hurdles for many already living on the margins and contribute to a culture of shame and stigma around abortion. And Donald Trump has made it clear that he would erect even more barriers—condemning us to a future in which the health care women need slips further and further out of reach every day.
We can't let that happen. Affordable health care is a basic human right. We have a responsibility to help all Americans realize that right—and not allow it to become a luxury reserved for those who can afford it.
That's why we need to work to defend and expand the Affordable Care Act, which covers 20 million more people—and level the health care playing field for women, who can no longer be charged more for the same coverage because of our gender. It's why we need to do more to bring down out-of-pocket health care costs that are still an insurmountable hurdle for too many. And it's why we need to fight back against restrictions on women's health across the country—and stop them from ever becoming law in the first place.
I've spent my career fighting for justice, equality, and opportunity. And Donald Trump's outrageous attack on women is about more than words—it's about the very real harm his policies would cause to women across the nation, and the disproportionate burden they will impose on low-income women, rural women, and women of color. This is a reproductive justice issue, a human rights issue, and an economic issue. Most of all, it's an issue of fundamental justice and equality under the law—and these attacks from politicians like Donald Trump are an affront to everything we should be striving for as a country.
Donald Trump's comments are horrific—and telling.
By Hillary Clinton
All of the Republican frontrunners for president want to make abortion illegal. Now Donald Trump has said how he'd enforce that prohibition: punishing women and doctors.
Donald Trump can try to distance himself from his comments all he wants. But we all heard what he said. As Maya Angelou said, ""When people show you who they are, believe them.""
Donald Trump keeps showing us who he is. We should believe him.
But it's important to remember that he's not alone. Donald Trump is just saying what Republican politicians across the country believe—everyone who has signed and voted for laws to defund Planned Parenthood, force women to undergo invasive and medically unnecessary procedures before ending a pregnancy, mandate that doctors recite misleading information to patients, and shutter every abortion provider for miles. These are laws that are meant to shame women and block their access to health care. That's their purpose.
We don't need to imagine the consequences of these laws. It's unfolding right before our eyes.
Right now, the Supreme Court is weighing whether a Texas law imposing unnecessary, expensive requirements on doctors who perform abortions will be allowed to stand. It's the biggest challenge to Roe v. Wade in a generation. There are so few abortion providers in Texas that getting an abortion can mean taking time off work, finding child care, driving halfway across a state the size of France, and spending a night in a hotel—any one of these things many women simply can't afford. If the Supreme Court rules that this law is constitutional, there could be just 10 abortion providers left in all of Texas—a place that 5.4 million women of reproductive age call home.
If you have to jump through multiple hoops to access a right, it's like not having that right at all. It's a privilege for the wealthy. And when politicians put up barriers that make it all but impossible for low-income women to get an abortion, they're jeopardizing women's health, economic security, and futures. That's just plain wrong.
I come to this issue as a woman, a mother, a grandmother, and a former lawyer. I also come to it as a former First Lady and Secretary of State. On behalf of the United States, I traveled to places where girls are married off as soon as they're old enough to bear children, because their worth is determined by their fertility, and where the denial of family planning consigns women to lives of hardship. I visited countries where governments have strictly regulated women's reproduction—either forcing women to have abortions or forcing women to get pregnant and give birth.
Everything I've seen has convinced me that life is freer, fairer, healthier, safer, and far more humane when women everywhere are empowered to make their own reproductive decisions.
And everything I've heard from Donald Trump and his fellow Republican candidates for president has convinced me that they have no regard for women or our ability to maintain autonomy over our own lives and futures.
They all want limited government—except when it comes to intruding on women's health.
Reproductive health and rights are a fundamental part of women's health and rights. And reproductive health includes abortion. So defending women's health and rights means defending access to abortion—not just in principle but in practice.
In 1995, I traveled to Beijing for the Fourth U.N. World Conference on Women. I addressed human rights abuses in China—including violations of reproductive rights. The message of that conference still echoes around the world today: women's rights are human rights. And reproductive rights are human rights, too.
We need to repeal laws like the Hyde Amendment that make it harder for low-income women, and disproportionately women of color, to exercise their full reproductive rights. We need to fight against the erosion of rights at the state level, where Republicans have signed laws designed to shame and coerce women and defund Planned Parenthood. We need to ensure that patients and staff are safe to walk into health centers without facing harassment, bullying, or violence. And we must always, always stand with the brave women and men across our country who are as committed as ever to providing safe and legal abortion care, even in places where that right is under concerted attack.
Whenever politicians become involved in deciding whether, when, and how a woman becomes a mother, it's not just degrading—it's dangerous. Few decisions are more sacred or intensely personal, and women deserve to make them for ourselves.
Here's the good news: While Donald Trump is a bully, voters will have our say at the ballot box. So if you disagree with his comments, you've got to vote. Vote like your health and rights depend on it. Because they do.

In 1965, after years of exploitation and unsafe working conditions, farm workers from across the country came together to organize for immigrant rights, higher wages, Latino rights, and dignity.
The group that came together then is now known as the United Farm Workers. Started and built by C?sar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, and Larry Itliong, the union fights on behalf of the men and women who do some of the most back-breaking labor in the country.
Yesterday, they endorsed Hillary Clinton for president.
But before they did, Hillary met with UFW members to hear directly from them—and a mother shared the very personal reason she's standing with Hillary.

Is there someone in your life who came to mind when you were deciding who to vote for?
My mother came from Africa, to here, just on faith alone. All she had in her pocket was her faith that we were going to have a better life if we came to America. And she said, we're gonna make a better life, and she put her best foot forward. And here we are, 30 years later. It takes one person just to say, ""Hey, I can make a change,"" and then the rest follows. I didn't speak English, my mother didn't speak English, and look where we are now.
Is your mom voting too?
She just registered to vote last year, so this will be her first time to vote. And it will be so historic, being able to vote for the first woman president. I think my mother is one of the strongest people I know. I look up to her. No matter how life punches her or knocks her down, she always gets up, and she never feels sorry or pity for herself.
It's going to be three generations voting. That's amazing. My girls are 22 and 23, so they can actually vote this time. It's going to be quite a moment for us—from apartheid to America, from racism to equality, women's rights, voting rights. It's amazing to think that if we stop and say, hey look, let's just take one step at a time, one foot in front of another, we'll get somewhere. Slowly but surely.
What is it about Hillary Clinton that drew you to her in this election?
Being a woman, being a grandmother, being a mother—it's very important to have someone who understands us and who knows where we want to go and where we have been. When President Obama ran, I was passionate. But Hillary has just lit that fire inside me to want to say, ""You know what? It is time to stand for something.""

Is there an issue that's front of mind for you in this election?
I'm confessing right now: There is a co-worker I have who is male, who hasn't been working where I work for as long as I have, and I recently found out he was getting paid more than me. Yeah—I was shocked. Hillary is fighting for equal pay. And I'm fighting for equal pay.
What's it going to mean to you to vote for a woman candidate for president?
It's just going to be so huge. I wasn't old enough to vote for Hillary when she was first running in 2008. I was telling my friends that they all had to get out and vote.
I know President Obama is black, and I'm an African-American female, but for women, this is huge, and I think for me to see a woman on that ballot and for me to just go vote for Hillary, I'm just going to throw my heels off.
If you could tell Hillary one thing—anything at all—what would it be?
You go, girl!

Patrick, you can't even vote yet. So why are you getting involved in this election?
Patrick: I love to hear the issues, and I volunteer getting other people out to vote. I've done 20 hours of calling, and then I hope to canvass in my region. Even though I can't vote, I just love to be involved in politics.
Patty: I actually take him with me when we go to vote, so that he can see the process. We talk about it. Most of our views are the same, sometimes they are a little different. But at least he's been exposed to it and he can make up his mind for himself. Patrick just seems to have a passion for it. I've always been interested in it, but you know, when it's just yourself, it's kind of hard to drum up the enthusiasm. When you have a child excited about it, you get excited about it, and you get more involved in the process itself. When he got me involved, I thought, man, this is kind of fun.
What's one issue that motivates you to vote this year?
Patty: Hillary wants to put money toward Alzheimer's research. Patrick's grandmother has Alzheimer's, so it's something that hits home. It's hard. It's awful when you see a great mind just wasting away. I just hope this is the next step toward finding a cure—and it's important to our family that Hillary's fighting for this too.

When did you first realize you were going to vote for Hillary?
Well, I've never had any doubt otherwise—I was supporting her from the beginning, even in 2008. Hillary has always shown a desire to help the downtrodden or help people in general. And I just thought from the beginning that she had the best chance to win the presidency and be a good president.
When you go cast your ballot today, who or what will be on your mind?
The people that I'm thinking about are the next Supreme Court justices. That really is the most important thing in my mind. Our next president selects the next Supreme Court justices. And if it's a Republican, we get a staunch, diehard conservative Supreme Court. And all of our rights that we've gained till now will be gradually just stripped away.
So let's imagine it's January 20, 2017, and a Republican president has just taken the oath of office. What's going through your mind?
Oh Lord, that's a horrible thought.
Well, probably the thing that's going through my mind is Obamacare will probably get repealed, provided that the House and Senate remain Republican. So we'll probably lose Obamacare and go into chaos over what will replace it. We will have eventually higher taxes and all our civil rights and civil liberties will be restricted more than they are. But the Supreme Court—that scares me more than anything.
Chanel Shahnami

Was there a moment that sparked you to pay attention politics in the first place?
Yes—unfortunately, it was not for the greatest reasons, but because of September 11. My dad's from Iran, and he's a Muslim. So in high school, people didn't say the nicest things, calling me a terrorist, calling me that to identify me as something that they thought my father was. And so because of a lot of discrimination I went through, I turned to politics, to understand what is going on in the world and in the media and why people are saying these heinous things about me. And I took the time to study all the parties, to see which ones my identity and my beliefs fit. My dad's a Democrat, but my mom's a Republican, and I thought that being a Democrat fit for the majority of people—the people who don't have a voice, the people who don't speak English, the people who are coming here because America is a land of opportunity.
What was it like growing up in a mixed political household?
[Laughs.]
My mom was not as in-your-face about it as my dad. But it was great. It was very open—we always talked about things that were going on within the government to keep us educated. My dad grew up in Iran, but he learned a lot about the American government and how the system works. And he thought it was really important for his kids to understand that and be involved and have a voice and express how we feel about what's going on in our country. And my mom's family is from Cuba—so to have that freedom to do that is not something they were able to do. So it's something they take advantage of, and instilled that into us, and really let us be who we want to be. I've been a Democrat, but it's because I was able to choose that and figure out who I am within this society.

How long have you been following politics?
Meredith: All my life. My father was in the Georgia legislature when I was a child. It was an interesting time—there were a lot of issues around integration, and my dad fought to keep public schools open. That kind of set the pace and my outlook and views on helping the underserved. And I've always been a Democrat.
And now Celia, my granddaughter, is about to turn 10 years old—but she has always been engaged in current affairs and what's going on. This is part of being a person, a citizen—someone who cares about other people.
What sets Hillary apart from the other candidates in this race?
Meredith: I feel like she has so much experience on the global stage. And that's just important to everybody abroad and at home. I don't think we need a novice trying to figure out how things work. We just need civil dialogue. We need to work together.
What would it mean to you both if there was a woman president?
Celia: That would be awesome! I think she would be a great president. I really like our country the way it is. But if Hillary were running it, it would be even better.
Meredith: Well, I didn't think there wouldn't be a woman president in my lifetime—after all, Margaret Thatcher was elected in the U.K. all those years ago. But for Celia, I think all doors are open to her already, because she knows that they're open and she can follow her dreams. But everything like this makes it a little bit easier.

Here's Why It Matters,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116852,Hillary Clinton,"There's still a lot of voting left to do—but she's off to a great start.
As of Saturday, March 5, Hillary Clinton leads the pledged delegate count for the Democratic presidential nomination by 204 delegates.
What does that mean?
Whoever earns the majority of delegates will be the Democratic nominee, and Hillary is right on track. Right now, Hillary is leading by a wider delegate margin than President Obama was at any point during the 2008 primary.
What is a delegate, anyway?
Democratic delegates will represent the party at its national convention this summer. When primary voters and caucus-goers go to the polls, they're actually choosing which candidate to pledge delegates to—and the candidate with the majority of delegates at the convention will become the Democratic presidential nominee.
Delegates are awarded based on how much support each candidate receives. There are 4,051 pledged delegates—out of 4,765 total delegates—up for grabs in the state contests, with a specific number awarded in every caucus and primary. In order to clinch the nomination, a candidate needs 2,383 total delegates.
So what's next?
166 delegates are up for grabs Tuesday in Michigan and Mississippi—and another six will be awarded Saturday in the Northern Mariana Islands. Then it's on to ""mini-Super Tuesday,"" when voters head to the polls in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Missouri, and Illinois for a combined total of 691 pledged delegates.
The Democratic nominating contest is far from over—and Hillary is ready to work hard and earn to every vote she can in the upcoming contests. But thanks to the hard work of organizers and volunteers across the country, Hillary has gotten off to a great start in the Democratic nominating contest.

Hillary Clinton has won nearly all the editorial board endorsements so far in the Democratic primary.
And heading into the next wave of state contests, the Miami Herald?1,? Orlando Sentinel?2, Chicago Sun-Times?3,?Jackson Clarion-Ledger?4, St. Louis Post-Dispatch?5, Jackson Advocate?6,?Portland Press Herald?7, and Sun Sentinel?8 have joined the list.?Here's why they're urging their readers to vote for Hillary:
She has been fighting for progressive issues throughout her career.
""Mrs. Clinton needs no introduction when she comes to our neighborhood. We know her and her work to improve the quality of life for all. Since graduating from college decades ago, she consistently has used her education and talents to advocate for those causes most dear to all Americans. For example, when she could have worked anywhere with her Yale Law School degree, she decided her first job would be working with Marian Wright Edelman at the Children's Defense Fund.""—Jackson Advocate (Mississippi)
She has real, substantive policy proposals that will make a difference in people's lives ...
""She has mastered the detailed approach to policy on a wide range of issues, everything from healthcare to foreign policy. ... and has the character to confront critics in Congress—or work with them in a spirit of compromise. No candidate in either party can match her r?sum? for the job of president."" —Miami Herald (Florida)
""Clinton has the experience and the temperament needed to navigate the complicated politics of a sharply divided nation. We think she would be best suited to fight to preserve social programs, which are always under attack, as well as to seize opportunities to make small but significant gains that improve people's lives.""?—Portland Press Herald (Maine)
... and she has the experience and tenacity to make them a reality.
""She was known as a hard worker in the Senate who was willing to reach across the aisle. ... It's telling that in the current campaign, Clinton has won endorsements from 40 U.S. senators, 13 former senators and more than 100 House members.""?—Orlando Sentinel (Florida)
""In Hillary Clinton we see the possibility of not only the first woman American president, but also the first president in awhile who might have the professional and personal skills to get Washington back to real governing. Our endorsement goes to Clinton. It's an easy call.""?—Chicago Sun-Times (Illinois)
""She is not an idealist, but a pragmatist who is dedicated to fighting for her principles while understanding that compromise is the bedrock of our republic government. It is an approach to leadership sadly missing today, and we feel she would help restore it as president.""?—Jackson Clarion-Ledger (Mississippi)
""She would work on behalf of her party to stop the nation's dangerous lurch toward political extremism. Her demonstrable toughness and perseverance is a quality Americans must demand in their next president.""?—St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)
""She would not need training wheels if she were to become the Democratic nominee and the first female president. But while Hillary Rodham Clinton would make history if she were elected in November, the more important point for voters in the Florida primary is that she would make a good president.""?—Sun Sentinel (Florida)

Hillary Clinton took the stage in Flint, Michigan, for the seventh debate of the Democratic primary. Here were her best moments of the night.
She continued to speak up for the people of Flint.

She pointed out a key difference between the two candidates on stage: One voted to fund the bailout that saved the auto industry—and one didn't.

She opened up about her faith.
"" I pray very specifically for people whom I know by name. People who either have gone through or are experiencing difficult times, illness, divorce, death, disappointment, all of the life experiences that confront most of us. I pray for the will of God to be known that we can know it and to the best of our limited ability, try to follow it and fulfill it.""
"" I have said many times that, you know, I am a praying person, and if I hadn't been during the time I was in the White House, I would have become one. Because it's very hard to imagine living under that kind of pressure without being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith. So I do pray for people in authority. I try to think about what they are going through, even when I disagree with them. Trying to find some common ground, some common understanding that perhaps can make me more empathetic. I don't always succeed. I will tell you that. So I pray on a pretty regular basis during the day, because I need that strength, and I need that support.""
She stood by the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre and took on the gun manufacturers.
She pushed back with the facts.
And she discussed the role that race plays in America—and in her own life.
"" Being a white person in the United States of America, I know that I have never had the experience that so many people, the people in this audience, have had. And I think it's incumbent upon me—and what I have been trying to talk about during this campaign—is to urge white people to think about what it is like to have 'the talk' with your kids, scared that your sons or daughters, even, could get in trouble for no good reason whatsoever like Sandra Bland and end up dead in a jail in Texas.""
"" And I have spent a lot of time with the mothers of African-American children who have lost them, Trayvon Martin's mother. And I've gotten to know them. I've listened to them. And it has been incredibly humbling because I can't pretend to have the experience that you have had and others have had. But I will do everything that I possibly can to not only do the best to understand and to empathize, but to tear down the barriers of systemic racism that are in the criminal justice system, in the employment system, in the education and health care system. That is what I will try to do to deal with what I know is the racism that still stalks our country."""

""The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.""
The 15th Amendment is clear.
Since the late 1800s, African Americans have been fighting for the right to vote—and today, we are still fighting for that sacred right. In the 1950s and 60s we fought to give our children a quality education while a majority of black children were limited to poor segregated schools, and we fought to end the scourge of racism that gripped our country.
Fifty three years ago, my husband, Medgar Evers, was assassinated in our driveway, after returning home from a mass meeting encouraging voter registration.
Myrlie, comforting her son at her husband's funeral.
Medgar always knew that progress depended on protecting our access to the ballot box. The vote, he always believed, was the best way to achieve justice and equality. Medgar once said ""In the racial picture, things will never be as they once were. History has reached a turning point here and over the world."" This statement was true then and is even truer today.
After decades of slow but steady progress, the rights that my husband and many others fought and died for are threatened like never before. In 2011, the state of Mississippi held a referendum, passing a restrictive voter ID law that should have required federal approval under the Voting Rights Act. Yet, in 2013, the conservative justices of the Supreme Court eliminated those protections, and the law went into effect just two years later.
Today, can we rely on the judicial branch of government to protect our right to vote? I'm not certain the answer is yes, and that is why I believe it's important that we have a leader in the White House who will be a champion for social justice and economic equality.
Hillary Clinton understands that we must make it easier, not harder, to vote. Her plan to restore the provisions of the Voting Rights Act that would prevent voter ID laws is progress. Her plan to implement automatic universal voter registration is progress. Her plan to create a nationwide standard of 20 days of early voting before elections, which will allow every American to exercise the right that so many fought for, is progress.
My home state of Mississippi has the second highest gun murder rate in the nation—nearly double the national average. Hillary Clinton has a plan to address gun violence with solutions that can actually be achieved. Gun violence is plaguing this country and robs us of 33,000 people every year. It is no coincidence that Mississippi has some of the country's most lenient firearms laws. Hillary Clinton is the candidate that stands up to the NRA.
Hillary Clinton is standing up for our children and has a bold vision that protects them; eliminates the school-to-prison pipeline; improves our education system; and enhances the opportunities for women. Our economic and criminal justice systems remain stacked against the most vulnerable people in our society, and young men of color are the unfortunate recipients of these injustices. Our youth are our future and must be protected. In the Senate, Hillary Clinton sponsored legislation to ban racial profiling, prosecute hate crimes, and eliminate race-based disparities in our health care system. She is making progress.
America needs a leader that will stand with communities of color to fight the injustices that still inundate our communities. Secretary Clinton is committed to fighting these battles. She has done it all her life, from her days at the Children's Defense Fund fighting for our children to helping those in need in Alabama. Secretary Clinton is a compassionate woman, and has been there during my time of tragedy and celebration.
She and her family shared in the 50th anniversary commemoration of my husband's life and legacy.
President Clinton and Myrlie, at the 50th anniversary commemoration of Medgar Evers' life.
Secretary Clinton will be there for you, and for all of us.
My husband and I have dedicated our lives to ensuring that men, women and children of color are treated with respect and dignity. Our quest did not end with his death in 1963. Today, I fight and stand for justice and equality for all Americans. Today, I stand for progress—and I stand for Hillary Clinton.

Advancing the rights of women and girls has been a central cause of Hillary Clinton's life—and she'll continue that fight as president.

1. Leading the U.S. delegation to the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, then-First Lady Hillary Clinton proudly declared that ""women's rights are human rights."" She called out human rights abuses by the Chinese government against women and girls, helped to cast a global spotlight on gender-based violence, and issued a call to action heard around the world.
2. As first lady, she worked to increase funding for child care, and she fought for family leave for new parents and families caring for a sick loved one.
3. As senator from New York, she and Senator Patty Murray of Washington waged a fight to protect women's health and make emergency contraception available over the counter.
4. She championed the Paycheck Fairness Act and co-sponsored the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to help ensure equal pay for women's work.
5. And she proposed national paid sick leave as well as paid parental leave to all federal employees.
6. As secretary of state, she championed programs to advance women's economic participation, address gender-based violence, and elevate the status of women and girls around the world.
7. She created the role of ambassador-at-large for global women's issues to ensure women's rights would be a core priority of U.S. foreign policy.
8. She spearheaded a U.N. resolution to fight against sexual assault in conflict zones.
9. Along with advancing gender equality abroad, she championed the needs of women and families within the State Department by instituting family-friendly work policies.
Hillary has been fighting for women and girls her entire career—and she's just getting started."

Shirley Skinner has seen a lot.
Shirley, celebrating her 100th birthday.
Born in 1915—five years before most women could legally vote in America—Shirley has lived through the Great Depression, two world wars, the Civil Rights Movement, and the moon landing.
In that time, she's seen incredible progress in America. And today, Shirley is rooting for something she never thought she'd live to see: the first woman president of the United States.
Shirley aboard the RMS Mauretania, 1952
Shirley was only 5 years old when most women got the right the vote, but she remembers the reactions. ""People would say that it was going to be terrible, that the country was going to go to the devil,"" she says.
She's right: One of the more popular arguments against allowing women to vote was, in the words of one anti-suffrage group, ""80 percent of the women eligible to vote are married and can only double or annul their husbands' votes.""
""... in some States more voting women than voting men will place the Government under petticoat rule.""
But Shirley also remembers her mother coyly telling critics of the 19th Amendment, ""We'll see.""
Shirley she set out to build her own life, on her own terms—but at that time, it didn't come easily.
Shirley shopping for fruit, 1952
She remembers how hard it was for women to accomplish the simplest things: When she tried to get a mortgage on her own, the bank told her, ""Well, that won't do."" When she tried to buy a car, they asked her if it was for her husband. And when she went to buy a farm, the seller all but laughed in her face.
But attitudes like that only made Shirley work harder. Eventually, she got her own car—a Ford. ""We were always Ford people,"" she says proudly.
Shirley's Ford
And though it raised eyebrows, Shirley even taught herself how to drive—a skill that would prove useful as the men in her hometown shipped off to fight in World War II.
While the war raged on, Shirley became a chauffeur on Long Island, joining the growing movement of women who got ""war jobs"" in order to keep the country moving.
And sure enough, Shirley got her farm, too.
Shirley and her mother on Shirley's farm in upstate New York, 1939
The more she shrugged off people's narrow attitudes about women, the easier it became to forge ahead. ""I wasn't stopping,"" she says. ""I kept going.""
In 1936, Shirley cast her first vote for Franklin Delano Roosevelt—and she's been voting the progressive ticket ever since. ""I've always been a Democrat,"" she says proudly.
And as for today's Republicans?
""Well, some of the men aren't very good,"" Shirley says, with all the diplomacy she can muster.
For Shirley, who lived through the evolution of women's rights in America, having a woman hold the highest office in this country is more than symbolic. It's real, tangible evidence of how far women have come over the last century.
A revolutionary declaration from Hillary Clinton at the 1995 UN World Conference on Women.
Shirley is quick to point out that it's not just about electing any woman.
She's always thought highly of Hillary Clinton. ""She was always doing something,"" she says. She's a fan of Hillary's policies, too—particularly the ones that will affect seniors, like protecting and expanding Social Security and Medicaid.
Shirley is firmly committed to her plans to vote in this election. And in the meantime, she's letting everyone know who she's voting for and why—and working tirelessly to turn supporters out for Hillary Clinton.
Because if there's one thing Shirley has learned over a lifetime of progress, it's that there's only one way to shatter a glass ceiling: with hard work, one crack at a time.

Confused about the Democratic primary process? Hillary Clinton's delegate strategist—known around headquarters as ""Delegate Dave""—has you covered.
Here's the bottom line: The primary is a race for delegates.
When voters and caucus-goers go to the polls in each state, they're actually voting to pledge delegates to a particular candidate.
For example, on Tuesday:
That means Bernie Sanders only netted a handful of delegates in Michigan, but Hillary Clinton gained a huge number in Mississippi.
So where does Hillary stand in the race for delegates?
Right now, Hillary Clinton is leading by more than 200 delegates—and it will get harder and harder to catch up to her as the race goes on.
But there's still have plenty of work to do. Hillary needs your help (and your vote) to lock up even more delegates so she can win the nomination and go on to win in November.

Americans are working harder than ever—but while corporate profits are on the rise, paychecks have barely budged in the last two decades. Meanwhile, the average CEO at some of America's biggest companies earns more than 200 times more than the median worker. As president, Hillary Clinton will make it her mission to change that.
She'll go to bat for workers, and go toe-to-toe with corporations on their behalf.
At a major economic speech in Detroit, she put corporate CEOs on notice.

She didn't hesitate to name names.
She made an example of Nabisco, which took tax breaks from the state of Illinois and then announced it would outsource production to Mexico and lay off 600 Chicago workers.
She also took Johnson Controls to task for benefiting from a government bailout and then using a loophole to avoid paying its fair share of U.S. taxes.
These are just two examples of companies that game the system to increase profits—and for too long, American taxpayers and workers have picked up the slack.
Hillary will end the loopholes that reward companies for moving overseas—and she'll make companies that export jobs give back the tax breaks they've received in America.
Instead, she'll reward companies that are doing right by their employees, providing tax incentives for businesses that offer high-quality training and share profits with their workers.
Because more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans is good for businesses—and our economy."

Why That's a Bigger Deal Than You Think,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116932,Hillary Clinton,"Time for some delegate math.
On Saturday, Hillary Clinton won the caucus in a tiny U.S. territory many Americans have never heard of: the Northern Mariana Islands. The Pacific island group had just 189 caucus-goers—but it matters more than you think.
Because at the end of the day, the Democratic primary is a race for delegates. When voters and caucus-goers head to the polls, they're actually pledging delegates to a candidate. And the candidate with the majority of delegates wins the nomination.
And sometimes fighting for every delegate takes a little creativity, as TIME Magazine reports:
Before Saturday, Hillary led Bernie Sanders by 221 delegates—and more than 1.6 million votes. Her win in the Northern Marianas put her ahead by two more delegates—coincidentally the same number of delegates she gained by winning Iowa.
Between her victories in the Northern Marianas and her Super Tuesday win in another small territory, American Samoa, Hillary gained four delegates—the same number Bernie Sanders picked up in Michigan.
In other words: a huge win in a small contest can matter just as much as a close win in a big state.
And Hillary's delegate lead will be harder and harder to close as the race goes on.
Bottom line: We're in great shape. But there's still a lot of work to do.
That's why Hillary and the team are out there working for every last vote and delegate—in every last state and territory, big or small.
P.S. You can get your own Northern Mariana Islanders for Hillary shirt (or a shirt from your home state) here.

Lolisa Wallace
Miami, Florida
Mathematician (and reigning Ms. Miami-Dade County)
Why did you go see Hillary speak in Miami?
I went because I want to be informed on the candidate I want to vote for. I am an advocate for education, I appreciate her policies—and I appreciate that she supports teachers.
What issue are you most concerned with in this election?
We have a high transient population here [in Miami], and as a teacher, I get kids all the time with stories. ""This week we slept in our car,"" or ""We are staying in my aunt's house because my dad got deported."" I see them on a day-to-day basis. [Hillary] will do everything within the law to do something about it. She's not just selling a dream. She's said she will do everything possible to keep families together.
And as a resident of south Florida, global warming is also important. Climate change is real and sea levels are rising—she is going to work to make sure that our city stays afloat.
Josefina Batista
Miami, Florida
Retired high school biology and chemistry teacher
Why did you come see Hillary speak in Miami?
I have been a Hillary supporter and fan for decades. I voted for her in 2008, and when she didn't get the nomination I voted for Obama. I think she'll be able to continue the progress that President Obama has made.
You attended Hillary's speech on Cuba in Miami last July—what did you think?
She explained everything very well. You know how she is, she went into a lot of detail. She understands the differences within the community, those who have been here for years versus others who haven't been here for as long. Her knowledge was extraordinary. Nothing that I would do differently.
What issue keeps you up at night?
What worries me, as a scientist, is the environment. Climate change—and addressing it when we can do something about it—is my main issue. I live a few miles from the water, maybe three miles, so I live in a much higher elevation—13 feet, which is high for Miami! But whenever you go closer to the coast it's very obvious.
I'm also a very big feminist, I have two daughters and issues like equal pay are important to me.

On a night of incredible primary victories, Hillary Clinton delivered a powerful victory speech in West Palm Beach, Florida. Here were six of the moments that had the crowd on their feet:
When she summed up this election in one sentence.
"" Tonight it's clearer than ever that this may be the most consequential campaign of our lifetimes.""
When she thanked everyone who made a phone call, knocked on a door, voted, or pitched in to support this campaign.
"" Because of you, our campaign has earned more votes than any other candidate, Democrat or Republican.""
When she reminded everybody what—and who—we're fighting for.
"" We're going to stand up for American workers and make sure no one takes advantage of us—not China, not Wall Street, not over-paid corporate executives.""
When she took on Donald Trump—just like she'll continue to do for the rest of this campaign.
"" When we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants, banning all Muslims from entering the United States, when he embraces torture—that doesn't make him strong, it makes him wrong.""
When she pledged to break down all the barriers holding Americans back.
"" Together we have to defend all of our rights—civil rights and voting rights, workers' rights and women's rights, LGBT rights and rights for people with disabilities.""
And when she nailed what really makes America great.
"" Nobody works harder than Americans. Nobody innovates better. Nobody dreams bigger. And if we work together, we can out-compete anyone in the world."""

Hillary Clinton has been calling out Donald Trump for his hateful, divisive rhetoric since the very beginning of this campaign.
She called him out for his racist comments on immigrants and denounced his proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the country. And as the violence at Trump's rallies escalates, Hillary continues to speak out—laying the blame exactly where it belongs.
It's no coincidence that his incendiary words have led to so much hateful action.
""What Trump has done is like a case of political arson,"" Hillary said. ""You know, he has lit the fire—and then he throws his hands up and claims that he shouldn't be held responsible.""
And as if his offensive statements about so many different groups of Americans weren't bad enough on their own, he has taken his comments even further.
This behavior goes against everything America stands for—and as a nation, we have an obligation to reject his message.
As a candidate—and as president—Hillary will stand up to Trump and everyone who tries to divide us.

In the latest episode of Comedy Central's ""Broad City,""?a show about a best-friend duo navigating post-college life in New York, Ilana Glazer's character spends the day volunteering for Hillary Clinton's campaign. On her way out the door, she and her best friend, Abbi, run into a surprise guest.
The episode wasn't actually filmed at campaign headquarters in Brooklyn—but the show's producers certainly captured the office vibe. Here's what they got right (and wrong).
The decor is pretty spot on.
The ""H"" wall featured in last night's episode is a dead ringer for the one at HQ—right down to the Post-its.
What's on the Post-its? Dozens of handwritten reminders from staffers and visitors about the things we're fighting for.
And just like the ""Broad City"" set, Hillary for America's walls are filled with logos, posters, and other campaign knick-knacks.
But the office isn't quite as sleek or spacious as Broad City makes it out to be.
At the real HQ, you'll find people working on every available surface.
Filing cabinets double as standing desks, and the hallways are pop-up conference rooms.
Our ""refreshments bar"" looks a little different.

President Obama has nominated Judge Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia.
Within minutes of the president's announcement, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged to deny this qualified, widely respected jurist a hearing or a vote.
It's yet another reminder of what's at stake in this election. As we wait to see whether Republicans in the U.S. Senate will do their jobs and fulfill their constitutional responsibility, keep one thing in mind:
The next president will likely have the opportunity to nominate several justices to the Supreme Court. And in doing so, she or he could have the power to transform the court—and American law—for generations to come.
Here's what is at stake:
1. Safe and legal abortion
The Supreme Court recently held oral arguments from an abortion case from Texas—and the state's access to safe and legal abortion hangs in the balance. Every leading Republican presidential candidate opposes abortion, and some even oppose exceptions for rape, incest, or to protect a woman's health. And many would overturn Roe v. Wade to make that happen.
2. Voting rights
Shelby County v. Holder gutted one of the most important parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a decision that has fueled a coordinated, Republican-led attack on the voting rights of people of color, low-income people, students, and seniors in recent years. (Ted Cruz has been one of the biggest cheerleaders for this decision.)
A conservative court could erode voting rights even further.
3. Marriage equality
The historic Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality was decided in a 5?4 split. A shift in the balance of power on the bench would provide the conservative wing of the court an opportunity to reverse that decision—an opportunity that a Republican president would be happy to give them (remember, every Republican candidate in this race denounced the Supreme Court's affirmation of marriage equality).
4. Campaign finance reform
The Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission allows corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence federal elections. It's a decision that has plenty of fans in the Republican Party.
Since that 2010 ruling, the conservative-led court has declined to revisit that decision. That's why Hillary has promised to do whatever it takes to overturn this ruling—including by fighting for a constitutional amendment.
5. Affordable health care
The Affordable Care Act has now survived two attempts to strike it down in the Supreme Court—but there are more challenges to the law making their way through the lower courts. John Kasich and Ted Cruz have spoken out against the court's Affordable Care Act rulings—and you can bet the justices they'd appoint would lead the charge against the law.
6. President Obama's executive actions on behalf of DREAMers and parents
Twenty-six states have brought a lawsuit against President Obama's executive actions (known as DACA/DAPA) to let DREAMers and parents remain in the United States. The Supreme Court will hear the case in this year. That matters—because every leading Republican presidential candidate wants to end the executive actions that would keep millions of families together.

Everyone has their own reasons for supporting Hillary—and thousands of people have shared their stories with the campaign.
Like Brandon from Nebraska, who sent this note with his donation:
"" My fiance and I were both diagnosed with chronic illnesses when we were very young, but because Hillary fought so hard to ensure CHIP was passed, our families didn't have to choose between buying groceries or buying medicine.""
Hannah from Indiana:
"" In 1995, the year I was born, Hillary Clinton made a revolutionary speech, proclaiming ""women's rights are human rights"". I heard it many years later, but it has inspired me every day since then to keep reaching higher. Hillary is a role model and an icon, who I know has inspired thousands of women like myself. As someone growing up with health problems, quality health care is important to me. Hillary is the only candidate I trust to improve our health care system. Now I'm navigating my way through college (and soon law school, like Hillary!), and I believe wholeheartedly in her plan to improve student debt. Her policies on gun safety, reproductive rights, climate change, education, immigration, her economics initiatives, and so much more made the choice to support her easy. I am happy to fight every day to elect Hillary Clinton, because I know she will fight for not only me, but this entire nation.""
Cathy from Arizona:
"" I was recently laid off from my job. I'm approaching retirement age and I'm struggling to pay my 90k in student loans. I believe Hillary will continue the work that President Obama started seven years ago to strengthen our economy and create new jobs. She will also protect women's rights, and work to reform the financing of student loans, because there is something very wrong when the interest rate on my student loan is higher than on my car loan. I haven't been able to give a much as I'd like to Hillary's campaign, but I have offered my time and talents in other ways to help get her elected. She IS truly the BEST candidate for America! I can't wait to refer to her as Madam President.""
And Regina from Florida:
"" My grandmother got her start as a teacher during the Japanese invasion of the Philippines during WWII. She moved to the U.S. when I was born to help out my mother, who worked full time. We lost my grandmother a couple years ago but she would have loved what Secretary Clinton stands for. I try to do her justice and stand up for the values she held so dear to her heart: fairness, equality and opportunity.""

People from all walks of life—and every corner of the country—are building this campaign $5, $10, and $20 at a time. They're coming together to elect the candidate who is fighting to break down all of the barriers that hold people back—and build ladders of opportunity instead.

She has an unrivaled command of the issues—domestic and international.
""Clinton's record of achievement is long and storied. She was a top student in college who went on to Yale Law School and to practice law. She served as first lady in the Clinton White House with an ambition to tackle huge national and global problems—universal health care and women's rights. ...?
""Her relationships with world figures would be invaluable in framing America's outreach beyond our shores. She is reticent to put American troops on ground the in highly charged conflicts in the Middle East, preferring instead to leave the ground fighting to Middle Eastern allies.""
She's never backed down from a tough fight.
""Few people engaged in the large policy debates of our land could withstand the kind of public scrutiny Clinton has endured during her near-lifetime of public service. ...?
""Her enemies, and they are legion, have sought to tear her down. But she is still standing, and on the cusp of the highest office in the land.""
And to sum it up:
"" She has the mettle to be president. The sound judgment to be commander in chief.""

In all of this clutter, there's been one consistent voice. A voice of tolerance and experience, from a candidate who's spent a lifetime fighting for the rights of the less fortunate. A candidate who knows firsthand the complexity of our international relationships.
That candidate is Hillary Clinton.
As this primary process continues, Hillary could soon have an insurmountable delegate lead and with that, the Democratic nomination. That would then make her the only grown-up in the room. And if ever there was a time for a grown-up, that time is now.

At a recent campaign event in Raleigh, North Carolina, Hillary Clinton underscored the need to break down all of the barriers that hold people back—including barriers to getting a world-class education.
""Education should be a great door-opener, and yet we know it often doesn't turn out that way,"" she said. ""Every child in this country deserves a good teacher in a good school—regardless of the ZIP code that you live in.""
Right now, our education system is failing too many children. And that's a huge problem—because the education kids receive has a direct effect on their ability to succeed as adults.
Our most vulnerable children aren't receiving the education they deserve, and that will affect lives—and our economy—for generations to come.

1. Our schools are more segregated than they were in 1968.
In 1954, the Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education ended school segregation, declaring that so-called ""separate but equal"" schools for black and white students were unconstitutional. In the years that followed, we finally began to slowly integrate our schools. But by 2011, U.S. schools were more segregated than they were in 1968.
2. We've made progress, but there's still a big achievement gap between white students and their black and Hispanic peers.
3. The school-to-prison pipeline takes many black students out of the classroom.
4. Students from low-income families have a harder time succeeding.
There's a strong connection between a family's socioeconomic status and how well a child does in school. Often, students who are living in poverty need more support from schools in order to succeed—but many schools are not able to provide that support.
5. Our teachers aren't being paid enough for the value of their work.
The average kindergarten teacher makes $53,480 a year, and there are about 158,000 kindergarten teachers in the United States. So in 2014, American kindergarten teachers made about $8.5 billion collectively.
By comparison, the top 25 hedge fund managers in America collectively earned $11.6 billion in 2015, according to Institutional Investor's Alpha magazine—and the magazine noted that 2015 was a bad year for hedge fund managers.
6. Race plays a role in determining whether a student will finish high school.
7. Black and Hispanic students are less likely to complete college than white students.
A great K–12 education can pay off in higher education, helping students to go to college and graduate with a degree. The difference in earnings between people who graduate from high school and those with college degrees is getting wider every year.
8. The United States is behind many industrialized nations when it comes to college completion rates.
Only about 50 percent of students who start college in the United States end up getting their degree—a percentage that is far lower than other nations.
9. The more students succeed, the better our economy does!
Improving K-12 education for black and Hispanic students wouldn't just help improve those students' lives, it would substantially grow our economy.
Hillary believes that we can improve our K-12 education system by focusing on teaching, learning, and community.
As president, Hillary will launch a national campaign to support and modernize the teaching profession, and make sure our teachers are paid like the future of the country is in their hands—because it is.
Hillary will also make sure that the best practices of community and charter schools are applied broadly, so that students in every public school can benefit, and ensure early childhood education is available everywhere.
And Hillary will invest in America's poorest schools and ensure all schools are meeting the needs of every student—because we have to close the gap for low-income students, students of color, English Language Learners, and students with disabilities.

Hillary has spent her career fighting to make quality, affordable health care available for every American—and after 6 years of the Affordable Care Act, we're closer than ever to making that a reality. As president, she'll build on the successes of the law—and she'll keep fighting to bring costs down and put health care within reach for everyone.

Here's How,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116707,Hillary Clinton,"""If Mr. Trump gets his way, it will be like Christmas in the Kremlin.""
Tuesday's terrorist attacks in Brussels were a horrifying reminder that the fight against ISIS and radical jihadist terrorism is far from over. Keeping us safe at home and defeating ISIS and global terrorism abroad are going to be some of the biggest challenges facing our next Commander-in-Chief. And that's why we need to elect a president who's prepared to do all parts of the job from day one.
Hillary Clinton responded to the Brussels attack, explaining her plan to defeat ISIS and the global terrorist movement, and sharing her vision for the role that America and our allies must play in the fight against terrorism around the world. Here's what you need to know (and you can read her full remarks here).
1. The threat of terrorism knows no borders—and we aren't going to stop it with a wall.
In the past year alone, terrorists have attacked transportation hubs in Brussels, a nightclub and restaurants in Paris, a office holiday party in San Bernardino, a hotel in West Africa, a beach resort in Tunisia, a market in Lebanon, a Russian passenger jet in the Sinai—and too many other places. The threat of terrorism in the 21st century is real, urgent, and borderless.
As Hillary said, ""Walls won't protect us from this threat. We can't contain ISIS—we must defeat ISIS.""
2. ISIS and terrorist groups like them are constantly adapting and operating across multiple spaces, so our response needs to be just as nimble and far-reaching.
Today, ISIS controls a sizable (yet shrinking) territory in Iraq and Syria—but it also leads a wider network that reaches across the Middle East and North Africa and into Europe, Asia, and North America and includes other terrorist groups. To win the war against global terrorism, Hillary argued that we have to do battle on each of these fronts.
And she has a plan to do that:
Hillary's plan calls for taking out ISIS's stronghold in Iraq and Syria by intensifying the current air campaign, stepping up support for local forces on the ground, and pursuing a diplomatic strategy to resolve Syria's civil war and Iraq's sectarian conflict between Sunnis and Shias—both of which have contributed to the rise of ISIS.
But we also have to dismantle the global terror network that supplies money, arms, propaganda, and fighters. That doesn't just mean going after enablers who help jihadist terrorists with things like travel and document forgery—it also means denying them virtual territory by discrediting their ideology online and stopping their digital recruitment strategies.
And hardening our defenses and building our resilience at home will help us discover and disrupt plots before they're carried out. That requires an intelligence surge, including partnering with Silicon Valley to track and analyze ISIS's social media posts and map jihadist networks online. As Hillary said, ""The tech community and the government have to stop seeing each other as adversaries and start working together to protect our safety and our privacy.""
3. Our alliances have been core pillars of American power for decades. They should be reinforced, not abandoned.
America's alliances make us stronger. Hillary argued that turning our back on our European allies who are on the front lines of the war on terror would be dangerous and foolish, and it would send the wrong signal to our friends and our foes. ""Putin already hopes to divide Europe,"" Hilary said. ""If Mr. Trump gets his way, it will be like Christmas in the Kremlin. It will make America less safe and the world more dangerous.""
What Republicans like Trump don't understand is that we need Europe. We need European intelligence and diplomacy, European banks fighting terrorist financing, European aircraft flying missions in the Middle East, and European special forces helping train and equip local forces fighting ISIS.
In fact, we need Europe to do more—and that's why Hillary called on our European partners to take more steps to stop the flow of foreign fighters to and from the Middle East. Knowing the identities of every fighter with a European passport who makes the trip, revoking passports and visas, and sharing information in real time is essential in this fight. So is a commitment by countries like Belgium to identify and invest in the neighborhoods, prisons, and schools where terrorist recruitment happens.
4. Despite what Republican candidates for president say, we need to rely on what actually works—not on what makes a catchy sound bite or riles up the base.
Take it from our nation's former chief diplomat: Bluster doesn't work—we can't just ""carpet bomb"" populated areas ""into oblivion,"" as Ted Cruz has suggested. Bigotry is also an unacceptable response: Hillary pointed out that it's just as dangerous to promote offensive, inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims—the very people who are most likely to recognize the warning signs of radicalization before it's too late and who are in the best position to block it. And torture—a tactic promoted by Donald Trump—puts our troops and civilians at greater risk. That's why Hillary pledged that if she's elected president, she will never condone or practice torture anywhere in the world.
So what does work? Smart, strong, steady leadership from the United States. As Hillary said, ""No other country can rally allies and partners to defeat ISIS and win the generational struggle against radical jihadist terrorism. Only the United States can mobilize common action on a global scale in defense of our peoples and our values. And that's exactly what we need to do.""

Here's How We Can Make It More Affordable,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116788,Hillary Clinton,"Hillary Clinton is the only candidate with a plan to take on the crisis in child care costs.
Quality child care during early childhood is one of the most important investments a parent can make in their child's future, but the cost of child care in America has been rising for decades.
Too many parents are forced to make an impossible choice between paying for child care or paying for other vital family expenses.
Between 2000 and 2012, child care costs rose by nearly 25 percent—while wages have remained stagnant.
In 27 states and the District of Columbia, the annual cost of infant child care is higher than a year's in-state college tuition and fees at a public university.
How big of an expense is child care for families?
Rapidly rising child care costs and stagnant wages mean that those costs are straining family budgets. According to the Center for American Progress, the average American family with children under five spends roughly 9 percent of their monthly income on child care. But many working families are paying much more.This issue affects millions of families.
And while child care costs continue to rise, more and more families rely on care. In more than 60 percent of households with children under six, all parents (single or married) are working.
And for the 4.8 million parents who are also students, they face high child care costs on top of rising tuition costs.
Hillary will fight to make child care affordable for families—not only because it's the right thing to do, but also because it's a smart thing to do. She will:
Increase federal funding to bring down the cost of child care for low-income families.
Provide tax relief to help lower costs for working families.
Double funding for the Early Head Start?Child Care partnership program.
Together, we can address the crisis in child care costs to make it easier for families to get ahead and stay ahead.

Rolling Stone made their first presidential endorsement in 1974—the year the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18.
Ever since, they've proudly backed the presidential candidate they believe is the best choice for young voters. This year, says Rolling Stone, the right candidate is Hillary Clinton.
"" Clinton not only has the experience and achievements as first lady, senator and secretary of state, but a commitment to social justice and human rights that began for her as a young woman. She was one of those college students in the Sixties who threw herself into the passionate causes of those times, and she continues to do so today.""
The author of Rolling Stone's endorsement believes Bernie Sanders is an important voice in this election—but Hillary Clinton is the best candidate to get things done.
"" Politics is a rough game, and has been throughout American history. Idealism and honesty are crucial qualities for me, but I also want someone with experience who knows how to fight hard. It's about social and economic justice and who gets the benefits and spoils of our society, and those who have them now are not about to let go of their share just because it's the right thing to do. And Clinton is a tough, thoroughly tested fighter.""
The endorsement also stressed the importance of this election.
"" This election is even more consequential, a tipping point like none since before the Civil War. We are at the culmination of a decades-long effort by the right wing to take over the government. ... The House, the Senate and, until a month ago, the Supreme Court are under the thumb of special interests and the extremely wealthy, who seek to roll back decades and decades of legislative progress that have furthered life, ?liberty and the pursuit of happiness.' And most horrifying of all, they would stop the world's last-minute effort to fight climate change, where the stakes are the fate of civilization as we now know it.""
The bottom line: Hillary will stop the Republicans from undoing all of the progress we've made under President Obama—and she'll fight to build on it.
"" On the question of experience, the ability to enact progressive change, and the issue of who can win the general election and the presidency, the clear and urgent choice is Hillary Clinton.""

This week in Arizona—a state that is home to some of the harshest anti-immigrant laws in the nation—Hillary once again pledged to make comprehensive immigration reform a top priority as president, and to do everything possible to keep families together.
One of those families is Lucia's.
Lucia is a Guatemalan immigrant Hillary met during the Univision Democratic town hall earlier this month. Alongside her five children, Lucia stood up on live TV and told her story. She explained that her husband had been deported three years prior—and her family hadn't seen him since.
Hillary promised she'd do everything she could to ensure other families wouldn't have to endure the same heartbreak—and she was so moved by Lucia's story that she talked about it in her primary night victory speech in Florida.
"" It's for the mother I met in Miami whose five children haven't seen their father since he was deported three years ago. She dreams of a day when deportations end and families are reunited.""
Lucia's family is just one of countless families that have been devastated by deportation. An estimated 5.5 million children in the United States have at least one parent who is undocumented—and 4.5 million of those children are U.S. citizens.
When Republicans talk about mass deportation, they're talking about ripping parents away from kids like Lucia's.
Hillary is committed to doing everything she can under the law to keep families together. That includes ending the three- and 10-year bar, a law that forces many undocumented immigrants to either leave the country for a period of three or 10 years, or keep their families intact and remain in the shadows.
But that's not enough. And that's why, as president, won't stop fighting until we've passed comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship—once and for all."

In a span of just 12 hours, North Carolina introduced, passed, and signed one of the most extreme anti-LGBT laws in the country. The law overrides existing city and county laws in the state that protect?lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender?people from discrimination.

North Carolina is not the only state where the rights of LGBT people are under attack.?
Anti-LGBT laws are on the books in dozens of states—and more are working their way through statehouses across the country. And in still more states, discrimination against LGBT residents is permitted under the law.
LGBT people lack comprehensive nondiscrimination protections under federal law—making the laws of individual states critically important.
But even under state law, there are significant gaps:
1. In 30 states, employees are at risk of being fired based on their gender identity.
2. Employees lack legal protections based on sexual orientation in 28 states.
3. LGBT people are not protected under the law from housing discrimination in 29 states—so if you're an LGBT person looking to rent or buy a house, you're at risk of being turned away because of who you are or who you love.
4. Twenty states do not recognize violence based on sexual orientation or gender identity as hate crimes.
And more anti-LGBT laws are working their way through state legislatures every day.
Right now, Mississippi is considering a bill that would let corporations discriminate against LGBT Mississippians. And Oklahoma lawmakers have filed 26 anti-LGBT bills already this year.
None of the Republicans running for president support full equality for LGBT Americans.
Donald Trump disagreed with the Supreme Court's marriage equality ruling. As governor of Ohio, John Kasich prevented LGBT couples from obtaining birth certificates for their children. And Senator Ted Cruz flat-out opposes non-discrimination protections for LGBT Americans—and has refused to speak out against so-called ""conversion therapy"" for minors.
These laws have serious consequences for LGBT Americans and their families.
Today, 65 percent of LGBT Americans report experiencing discrimination in their daily lives. Three-quarters of LGBT students say they've been harassed for their sexual orientation.
The statistics on bullying and harassment are even more staggering for transgender Americans. And 1 in 5 have been refused a home or apartment based on their gender identity.
This is why we need comprehensive LGBT equality protections.
What happened in North Carolina is the latest reminder that the fight for LGBT equality is far from over. As Hillary Clinton has said:
We have to keep fighting until every American can not only marry, but also live, work, pray, learn, and raise a family free from discrimination. And Hillary will do just that.

This afternoon in Madison, Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton laid out the stakes of one of the most important issues of the 2016 election: the Supreme Court. Here's what you need to know.
The Supreme Court shapes nearly every aspect of American life.
At its best, the Supreme Court is a place where the rights of every American are heard and protected. And that notion left a powerful impression on Hillary growing up.
In recent years, the Court has made a lot of consequential decisions—some that uphold those ideals, and some that undermine them.
The Court?""made same-sex marriage legal nationwide, preserved the Affordable Care Act—not once, but twice—and ensured equal access to education for women,"" Hillary said. However, it also ""cut the heart out of the Voting Rights Act. It overturned commonsense laws addressing gun violence.""?
Justice Scalia's recent death leaves the Supreme Court at a critical crossroads: His replacement could tip the ideological balance on the bench, determining whether the Court protects and advances the progress we've made as a nation—or dismantles Americans' fundamental rights, one ruling at a time.
Republicans know what's at stake. That's why they're stonewalling President Obama's nominee.
President Obama has done his constitutional duty to nominate a justice to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. But so far, Republicans in Congress are refusing to do theirs—denying his nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, a proper nomination hearing.
They'd rather undermine the president and stall until after the election—when they think they'll have a shot of reclaiming the White House. That's not only unprecedented, it's also undemocratic.
Republicans in Congress claim they're just waiting for a new president to give the American people a voice. But Hillary called their bluff:
"" As one of the more than 65 million Americans who voted to re-elect Barack Obama, I'd say my voice is being ignored right now because of their obstructionism. We chose a president. We chose him twice.""
But the battle over the Supreme Court is bigger than just one empty seat.
On Election Day, two justice will be older than 80—past the Supreme Court's average retirement age. That means the next president could appoint multiple justices. In doing so, he or she will have the power to transform the makeup of the Court for decades to come.
Why does that matter? Just look at the cases on the docket in this term alone.
There are big issues in front of the Court right now.
In other words: The Supreme Court could undermine fundamental rights—and the progress we've made.
As Hillary said:
"" As someone who has worked on every single one of these causes for decades, I see this as a make-or-break moment. If you care about the fairness of elections, the future of unions, racial disparities in universities, the rights of women, or the future of our planet, you should care about who wins the presidency and appoints the next Supreme Court justices.""
We can't let Donald Trump—or any other Republican—anywhere near the Court.
For years, Republicans have been quietly and effectively using the courts to impose their aggressive agenda where legislation has failed. Now there's a very real chance that Donald Trump—someone who believes Muslims should be banned from entering the country, who wants to kick out 11 million immigrants, and who thinks wages are too high—could be the person appointing Supreme Court justices, an attorney general, and federal judges at every level.
And we can't forget that Trump is far from alone when it comes to extreme rhetoric and tactics. Republicans, led by Ted Cruz, shut down the federal government rather than fund the Affordable Care Act in 2013. They nearly shut down the government again last fall over Planned Parenthood. And they did so with the blessing of their leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, who publicly stated that his and his party's No. 1 goal was to ensure that President Obama would be a one-term president.
As Hillary pointed out:
"" Donald Trump didn't come out of nowhere. What the Republicans have reaped with their extremist tactics, they are now sowing with Donald Trump's candidacy. ... When you have leaders willing to bring the whole government to a halt to make headlines, you may just give rise to candidates who promise to do even more radical and dangerous things—because once you make the extreme normal, you open the door to even worse.""
The bottom line: the Supreme Court can be our best vehicle for expanding rights—or rolling them back.
"" It depends on what the Court decides. And it depends on who's deciding.""Hillary
And we can't afford to let the Republicans make that call.

Here's Why,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116695,Hillary Clinton,"A record of results
In 2000, Hillary Clinton was the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from New York—and over the next eight years in office, she was a tireless champion for communities across the state.
Here are six ways she improved the lives of New Yorkers as senator.
1. She fought for New York after 9/11.
The day after the attacks on the World Trade Center, Hillary went to Ground Zero—and she quickly recognized that there would be lasting health problems for responders and others working at the site. She spoke out in the Senate to help secure $20 billion in federal aid for New York's recovery—and fought to secure $335 million in funding for health screening and treatment programs for first responders and volunteers who suffered health effects at the site.
2. She helped grow small businesses and create jobs.
Hillary worked across the aisle to help New Yorkers through the economic downturn—especially those from struggling upstate communities. She was a driving force behind raising the minimum wage, co-sponsoring or introducing bills to do it eight different times. She also helped launch Farm-to-Fork, an initiative to help New York farmers and winemakers sell their products to Manhattan restaurants and colleges. And she worked to expand broadband access to rural and underserved areas in the North Country.
3. She was a leading advocate for servicemembers and veterans.
As New York's first senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Hillary was a leading advocate for men and women in uniform, veterans, and their families. She fought to save the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, which preserved 800 jobs in New York. And she worked tireless to address the gaps in health care for servicemembers—by joining with Republican and Democratic colleagues to extend TRICARE health benefits to National Guard and Reserve members even when they're not deployed, securing assistance for families caring for loved ones with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), and providing funding for mental health and readjustment programs that help returning National Guard and Reserve members and their families.
4. She expanded educational opportunities.
Hillary fought to expand Head Start programs, which benefit more than 50,000 low-income New York families. And she worked to expand access to student loans and Pell Grants, so that more students would have the opportunity to go to college—regardless of their background or circumstances. She also introduced a bill to give Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) grants that would help underrepresented students enter health professions. And she helped start the first Eagle Academy for Young Men, a college prep school dedicated to educating young men of color.?
5. She fought to protect the health of families in underserved communities.
As chair of the Senate Superfund and Environmental Health subcommittee, Hillary made it her mission to protect families from environmental health hazards that disproportionately affect low-income communities of color. She introduced a bill to keep families in public housing safe from toxic lead paint, and she worked with then-Senator Barack Obama on legislation to keep kids safe from lead poisoning at child care facilities and to ban lead toys.
6. She helped protect New York's natural resources and expand clean energy.
From her first days as senator, Hillary made it a priority to protect New York's natural resources and develop the state's potential as a leader in clean energy. She worked to safeguard wildlife and the environment around the Great Lakes region and repeatedly pushed legislation to rein in industrial pollution. She also helped pave the way for a national heritage area to be created around Niagara Falls. And she teamed up with local leaders in Rochester to develop the nation's first urban ""green print,"" a plan for environmentally sustainable growth and alternative energy development.

Every year, the transgender community and our allies come together for Transgender Day of Visibility to celebrate the beauty and diversity of the transgender community, and to rededicate ourselves to combatting discrimination and securing equality for transgender people everywhere. Despite unprecedented visibility for the transgender community in media, popular culture, and politics, the reality remains that many trans people are still subjected to discrimination and violence simply for being who we are.
The stakes in this election could not be higher for the transgender community. That's why so many of us joined together last month to launch Trans United for Hillary, a national volunteer effort to educate, engage, and mobilize the trans community and our allies in support of Hillary Clinton. Hillary has a record of results for the trans community and has outlined the most detailed plan for trans equality ever proposed by a presidential candidate. She's called violence against transgender people—particularly trans women of color—a ""national crisis,"" made passage of the Equality Act one of her highest priorities, and affirmed the humanity and dignity of trans lives.
We know that we need a president who will prioritize breaking down barriers for all Americans, including transgender people. On this Transgender Day of Visibility, many transgender people from across the country are proud to stand up, be visible, and fight for Hillary—because we know she's fighting for us.
Sarah McBride
Wilmington, Delaware
When did you first start caring about politics?
I've been volunteering for candidates since the age of 10. When I came out, my passion for equality became all the more real and personal.What do you tell friends or family who may not have made up their mind about who to support?The presidency is the hardest job in the world, and requires someone who understands that our problems cannot be boiled down to one source or one solution.
When you vote in this election, will you be thinking about a specific person or issue?
I'll be thinking of my late husband Andy. Andy was a transgender man and passed away a little over a year ago at the age of 28. When we found out that Andy's cancer was terminal, he asked me to marry him. We held our wedding on the roof of our building. Just four days later, Andy passed away. As an LGBT health advocate, Andy knew better than most the impact of the Affordable Care Act in expanding access and opening up health care to LGBT Americans. I'll be thinking about his work and the need to preserve and build on the Affordable Care Act when I vote. But I'll also be thinking about the lesson I learned from his passing. Andy had the courage to live true to himself at a young age. He was supposed to have three quarters of his life as his authentic self. But because of circumstances beyond his control, he had less than a quarter. Some have even less than that. Every day matters when it comes to building a world where every person can live their life to the fullest.
Why do you support Hillary?
She's the only candidate running to have delivered tangible progress for the transgender community when she reformed passport policies at the State Department and added gender identity to the department's employment policies. She's laid out a detailed and life-saving platform on LGBT equality, and has routinely and proactively spoken about our needs as a community to LGBT and non-LGBT audiences alike. More than anything else, I'm supporting Hillary because, like she says, she's not a single issue candidate, because we do not live in a single issue country. I know she has the skills, experience, and solutions necessary to move equality and opportunity forward for people of all backgrounds and identities in every state.
Blossom Brown
Jackson, Mississippi
When did you first start caring about politics?
When I started to transition from male to female. Prior to that, I felt like politics were not my forte. But as I began to experience discrimination in both the education and health system, I felt that it was time for me to care about politics and vote carefully for the candidate who would best address our needs and be more inclusive of the trans community.
What do you tell friends or family who may not have made up their mind about who to support?
That they should vote for Hillary because she is inclusive of all communities, and that she can continue to make the positive progress in Washington. I always remind them that we do not need bigots of any kind in the White House, and we also do not need a candidate who thinks that certain groups should be banned from the United States. We need to have Hillary in office fighting for the rights of all American people!
When you vote in this election, will you be thinking about a specific person or issue?
As a trans-health advocate, it means a lot to me that all transgender people get to receive the entire appropriate health care we are entitled to—that we are not discriminated against and that we are treated like human beings and not as animals in the health system. I am seeing too many of my trans brothers and sisters who are dealing with this.
Barbra Siperstein
Edison, New Jersey
When did you first start caring about politics?
Growing up in Jersey City, I was always surrounded by politics and was politically aware. It was not until after my wife of 34 years died suddenly in late 2001 that I realized how stigmatized and vulnerable I was as a single transgender person, and how necessary it was to involve myself in the political system in order to create change, assert civil rights, and gain societal respect.
What do you tell friends or family who may not have made up their mind about who to support?I understand and share their fear, anger, and frustration. I tell them to clear the air and understand what is real and what is not, what is perceived may be partly true or not at all. I ask who is the one person who can step into the Oval Office prepared to act effectively from day one? Who has shown an effective learning curve and grown over the years? Who has done what she did as secretary of state and has a positive record of working with diverse people as a senator from New York?
When you vote in this election, will you be thinking about a specific person or issue? I will be thinking about my grandchildren and the kind of world and opportunities they will have to enable for themselves and their families a happy, comfortable, secure and productive life, regardless of race, be they male or female, straight or gay, cis or trans gender.
Why do you support Hillary?I believe that she wants to and is committed to doing the right thing. She has the experience, character, strength and learning ability to lead America better than any other candidate.
Lou Weaver
Houston, Texas
When did you first start caring about politics?
Eight years ago. When I started my cultural transition.
What do you tell friends or family who may not have made up their mind about who to support?
This is an important election and will have far reaching ramifications. In order to work towards equity for everyone, we need to elect the best candidate—and that is Hillary Rodham Clinton.
When you vote in this election, will you be thinking about a specific person or issue?
The futures of myself and my transgender siblings. The state of the country as a whole.
Why do you support Hillary?
I believe she is the best person to continue to move our country forward.
Zackary Drucker
Los Angeles, California
When did you first start caring about politics?
In fourth grade—the election of 1992: George Bush vs. Bill Clinton vs. Ross Perot. That was the first election I was consciously aware of, because I have a family who is solidly Democrat and they had been fairly disgusted of three terms with a Republican president. I remember watching the debates with my family, cutting newspaper clippings, and keeping them in a scrapbook!
What do you tell friends or family who may not have made up their mind about who to support?
If somebody hasn't made up their mind, it's important to at least stress the importance of voting Democrat. The war and hate mentality of Republicans is self-perpetuating, and it's stirring a pot of anti-American rage that is really dangerous for our future.
Why do you support Hillary?
I feel like beyond my personal rooting for Hillary and being a long-term supporter since her first senate race, as a member of the trans community, Hillary Clinton has such a solid plan for how to cement the rights of trans people in America, and women around the world. The rights of trans people and women is my number one priority in voting.
Ames Simmons
Atlanta, Georgia
When did you first start caring about politics?
I have always cared about politics, having been fortunate to have been raised with a strong commitment to civic responsibility and community leadership by two parents who had long federal service careers—and who imparted a similar love of policy and service to my community.
When you vote in this election, will you be thinking about a specific person or issue?
I absolutely voted in the Super Tuesday primary and will vote in the general election in November as a transgender person who cares very much about LGBTQ politics and policy in the U.S. I never gave any serious consideration to any candidate other than Hillary Clinton.
Why do you support Hillary?
I support Hillary because of her strong support of the LGBTQ community—and of trans issues in particular—and because she is tested and proven as a candidate who has the ability to get things done for our country. Hillary's ability to actually accomplish real and measurable progress for the trans community, who otherwise does not have sufficient statistical strength to get things done by ourselves, is significant. Hillary's commitment to progress in health care, to women's rights, to eradicating income inequality, to racial justice, are all deeply compelling factors in her candidacy.
Kimi Cole
Minden, Nevada
When did you first start caring about politics?
January, 2011. As my life was going through a major change, I became keenly aware of inequities toward transgender people. I decided to get involved in the political process and take a stand for fair treatment, rather than simply complaining from the sidelines.
What do you tell friends or family who may not have made up their mind about who to support?
I have gained tremendous respect for Secretary Clinton ?for her courage to tackle tough issues, her resilience in the face of brutal media scrutiny, and her overt commitment to proactively acknowledging and supporting the LGB and Transgender communities. #ImWithHer
When you vote in this election, will you be thinking about a specific person or issue?
In addition to the obviously dangerous challenges being foisted on the LGBT communities by conservative activists, it's also very important, to me, in an increasingly dangerous world, that we have a president who has a full grasp of the global stage, in order to comprehensively address challenges and dangers, while guiding our country forward.
Why do you support Hillary?
Hillary Clinton is the ONLY presidential candidate in 2016 with full understanding and ability to continue building on the progress realized during President Obama's administration.
Marisa Richmond
Nashville, Tennessee
When did you first start caring about politics?
When I was 4, my mother took me and my sister to see President Kennedy visit Nashville. We stood on the sidewalk in front of an old Texaco as the open limo motorcade went by. As he got right in front of me, the president turned and smiled and waved right at me. I have been a committed Democrat and political junkie ever since.
What do you tell friends or family who may not have made up their mind about who to support?
I respect my friends who ""Feel the Bern,"" so I do not try to change their minds. But if I am asked why I am supporting Hillary, I mention her experience in a number of areas, especially foreign policy, her longstanding support for universal health care, and her work for human rights, including the passport gender change policy from her days as secretary of state. She was also a co-sponsor of the Trans Inclusive Hate Crimes bill when she was a senator.
Jay Brown
Cheverly, Maryland
Why Hillary?
Leading up to November and on Election Day, there's no doubt in my mind that Hillary Clinton is the best candidate. I'm a transgender man, a dad of two young daughters and a progressive committed to social justice. When I think about her record and her positions on trans and LGBT equality, on HIV and AIDS, on women's rights—on a range of issues that matter most to me—I know she is going to work hard building a better tomorrow and pushing forward on the issues that matter most.
Janice Covington

When did you first start caring about politics?
1972—working on the campaign for Billy Creel for North Carolina Labor Commissioner!
What do you tell friends or family who may not have made up their mind about who to support?
Vote Democrat and for Hillary!
Why do you support Hillary?
Because I feel she is the most qualified.
Meghan Stabler
Round Rock, Texas
When did you first start caring about politics?
I've always cared. It's part of the civic duty we have as citizens, but most importantly it's important to stand up for what is right, to stand up for those who can't, and ultimately, move America forward to be a more perfect union.
What do you tell friends or family who may not have made up their mind about who to support?
I lay out the candidates and what they care about. Not just lip service or media sound bites, but real honest policies backed with experience is what matters.
Why do you support Hillary?
Hillary and I have met a number of times, and I know, from the conversations we've had and the look in her eye, that she passionately cares about LGBT equality and transgender equality in work, life, and military service. She is the only candidate who cares deeply about ALL of us.
Diego Sanchez
Boston, Massachusetts
When did you first start caring about politics?
My passion for politics began as a 12-year-old child, delivering flyers to re-elect Congressman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-TX-20), Texas's first Latino U.S. representative. I'm as fired up now as I was then!
What do you tell friends or family who may not have made up their minds about which candidate to support?
I tell friends and family members who are undecided about how to cast their vote for president three things: One: Register and vote, and get all of your friends to do the same. Two: Hillary Clinton must be our next president because of her public service experience, her passionate and fearless leadership, and her support of communities and people who cannot be forgotten and won't be by her. Three: These times are our most critical, and I will work hard to gain support from everyone I know or can meet.
When you caucus in this election, will you be thinking about a specific person or issue?
As an openly trans, aging, adopted, immigrant Latino man with roots in the deep South and New England, I will be thinking of LGBTQ elders and youth—especially trans and gender expansive youth of color. I know that with solid, supportive leadership under Hillary, we can not only have hope but live safely to end discrimination and with evidence to have even more hope for generations present and future.
Why do you support Hillary?
I support Hillary because I want our next president to be brilliant and brave, and she is both. Hillary will be a president who won't have to be taught to say the words ""transgender"" or ""equality."" I feel blessed to be a naturalized U.S. citizen, and I feel responsible for doing all I can to improve our nation for the people who will be here when I'm not. Supporting Hillary is an affirmative step toward that goal, part of plotting a path to make our nation safer for people who reflect the many intersecting aspects that comprise me.

Detroit, Michigan
Retired auto worker
What issue is most important to you this election?
Social Security. I'm 62, and I still feel like I've got a lot of life and a lot of volunteering to do—and I still gotta get paid. Saving our pensions, saving social security, paying our student loans.
Was there a particular moment when you decided to get involved in politics?
The 2008 auto bailout. After everything that we invested in the auto industry, to have it come to that. That's when I got heavily involved and realized the seriousness of this situation.
Why are you supporting Hillary?
She's a sister. I don't mean African American—a sister meaning a female that understands my pain. Who understands labor and then that your kids—once they grow up, you know—they're still getting paid minimum wage. She's in touch with being a parent. She's got more to offer because she is a mother. She feels that mother-child bond, and she's a new grandmother, so that triples how she feels about children and their welfare. I like everything about Hillary. I like her strength even though she went through some challenges. She stood strong, stood firm as a woman. She carried the banner that much higher.
Khodr Farhat
Dearborn, Michigan
Student at Henry Ford College
What was it like the first time you voted?
I came to America as an immigrant seven years ago when I was 14, and I became a citizen a few years ago. The first time I voted was the election of 2014—the local election—and I voted in the primary this year. And I'll be voting in every election from now on. Practicing this democratic role is essential for us as citizens to express our views, and it's a very important thing to practice voting. We have to be active players.
Why are you voting for Hillary?
She's the most qualified. She was first lady for eight years, senator, secretary of state. She knows what's going on in the country and the world. And we need somebody who accepts everybody. America is all about diversity, immigrants—it's not about excluding people. We need it to be united, always and forever.
What in your own life has influenced the way you think about politics?
I was born blind. When I immigrated, I didn't speak the language, and I didn't know anything about the U.S. It was a very challenging thing. ... I was able to learn the language and become a citizen. And now I use that motivation in my schooling; I'm a 4.0 student.
I'm so proud to live in America, a country that gave me everything. I'm involved in local politics: I'm running for the Dearborn Board of Education in November. I'm so proud to give back to the country that gave me everything I needed; that gave me opportunity, gave me dignity. I always say: I wish nothing but the greatest for America. God bless America.

By now you've probably heard the news: Donald Trump said he believes women should receive ""some form of punishment"" for seeking an abortion.
But when it comes to women's health and reproductive rights, Trump is really not so different from the other Republicans in the race—just look at the facts.
1. As governor of Ohio, John Kasich has restricted abortion access: He signed into law a ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy—which didn't include exceptions for rape, incest, or a woman's life. He defunded Planned Parenthood in Ohio, cutting more than $1 million in funding for health screenings and HIV testing. And because of restrictions he's signed into law, the only two abortion providers in southwest Ohio could soon close—making it that much harder for nearly half a million Ohio women to exercise their constitutional right.
2. Donald Trump promised that he would shut down the government rather than fund Planned Parenthood, which provides vital health care including birth control, cancer screenings, and yes—safe and legal abortion.
3. This isn't a hypothetical for Cruz: As a U.S. senator, he was?actually?willing to shut down the federal government in an attempt to defund Planned Parenthood.
4. As with all attacks on abortion access, 20-week bans are part of a deliberate, coordinated effort to chip away at women's constitutional right to safe and legal abortion. Abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy are extremely rare but often take place under serious and complex circumstances—at a time when women and their doctors need every medical option available.

She explained that while she's fortunate enough to be able to stay home with her 4-month-old daughter, most parents in her neighborhood don't have that option. And she's putting her faith in Hillary to do something about it.
It doesn't just hurt families—it holds our economy back. And It's time for that to change.
As Hillary explained, that's why she's fighting for guaranteed paid family leave.
Hillary's plan will guarantee workers—men and women—up to 12 weeks of paid family leave to care for a new child or ill family member. And she'll get it done by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share.

As a middle school teacher in Burlington, Vermont, Larry O'Keefe didn't just want his students to read about American history—he wanted them to understand it, love it, and talk to the people who experienced it. So, with the help of a fellow teacher, he created a program to help 7th- and 8th-graders organize trips across the country, hosted in churches, schools, and homes along the way.
One of those homes was the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1983.
After discussing that trip with a former student, Larry was inspired to write a letter to then-First Lady of Arkansas Hillary Clinton to share a memory that's stuck with him for decades.

It's Time To End That,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116791,Hillary Clinton,"Why it's so important that Hillary Clinton will work to end the ""subminimum wage""
During an event in Madison, Wisconsin, a young lawyer asked Hillary Clinton about an issue that doesn't get enough attention.
The woman wanted to know how we can stop companies from exploiting workers with disabilities and increase opportunities for people living with disabilities in America.
Workers with disabilities are sometimes paid what's known as a subminimum wage—a wage that's legally allowed to be lower than the federal minimum wage.
Under a loophole in our current law, employers can apply for special wage certificates, which allows companies to decide the wages of workers with disabilities through a comparison system.
This leads to many companies paying workers with disabilities wages that are far below the federal minimum wage: The average subminimum wage is an estimated $2.50 per hour, and companies have been found paying workers with disabilities as little as 6 cents per hour.
More than 200,000 workers with disabilities are currently earning subminimum wages.
"" When people talk about raising the minimum wage, they don't always talk about the legal loopholes that we have in it. ... I want to get rid of those, and I want to get rid of that for people with disabilities, too.""Hillary
Hillary will stop companies from taking advantage of workers with disabilities, because taking on the subminimum wage is more than an economic issue—it's a human rights issue."

If you've listened to the radio at any point in the past few decades, you've heard from Carole King—if not her distinctive voice, one of the more than 1,000 artists who have recorded her songs. A prolific singer-songwriter, she's blazed a trail for women in the music industry—and been a vocal advocate on behalf of the environment and other progressive causes.
The self-described ""New Yorker by birth and by heart"" recently dropped by Hillary Clinton's campaign headquarters in Brooklyn to talk about her earliest memories of politics, hard choices, and the conversation happening in today's Republican Party.
When did you first get involved in politics?
Oh, gosh. I canvassed for John F. Kennedy before I was old enough to vote for him. That was when the voting age was 21. Then, in 1972, I did a concert for McGovern. And in 1984 I got involved with the Gary Hart campaign in New Hampshire. I still have some really good friends from that—Senator Jeanne Shaheen ran his campaign. I was involved in the first President Clinton campaign—may there be a second President Clinton!—and then I got involved in John Kerry's campaign. So I've been doing this for a while.
What inspired you to get involved?
I have an issue! I'm a New Yorker by birth and by heart. But I live in Idaho, which also has my heart. It's the landscape and the people and just everything. And I became involved with an environmental project that would protect the Northern Rockies ecosystem. It has what are called wildlife corridors, where birds can migrate and so on. Right now, they're being cut down by the timber industry, and these forests are all going away. It's contributing to climate change, and that affects people everywhere. I've been involved in that for the last 25 years.
And what inspired you to support Hillary?
I support Hillary because she will support the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and make sure it can continue to do the work that it was intended to do. That's a very big issue.
The other thing is the fact that she understands the big picture. She doesn't just see things as this issue isolated, or that issue isolated. For example, she sees the intersection between climate change, the environment, and the economy. She understands that creating jobs in renewable energy in the United States would not only help combat climate change, it would create jobs—and those jobs would not be outsourceable. Her understanding of the big picture is the single greatest advantage she has over any candidate running.
What kind of president do you think Hillary would be?
When she represented New York, she represented everyone in New York. If she is fortunate enough to be elected president—if we are fortunate enough to have her be elected—she will represent everyone in America.
You've been involved in your fair share of elections over the years, and you've been following this one closely. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing?
I will say that there is a dynamic going on in the Republican Party that is outside of my radar screen. I don't understand how people can be campaigning about things that are so low on the spectrum of intellect, of understanding, of bringing people together, of seeing the big picture of what would really be good for the world.
Hillary understands that we are interconnected with the rest of the world, so anything you do affects people worldwide. And certainly she would represent the people of the United States first and foremost, but she is also thinking about how to integrate us into the rest of the world in a manner that acknowledges our commonality rather than our differences.
Of course, there are many countries that are not as easily reasoned with, just as there are many Republican candidates for president that are not as easily reasoned with. But I think it's so important to have a leader for our country who gets the need for inclusivity and working together. I think people who think about limited issues, who don't see the interconnectedness the way she does, are missing something crucial.
What about on the Democratic side?
As for the people who support Bernie Sanders: I get them. When I have discussions with friends who are Bernie supporters, it's always respectful. We really do want the same things. But they say, ""I think Bernie is the way to get there."" And I say, ""Where's his plan?"" I have no problem with the idea of free college, but I don't see how that happens. I do have a problem, however, with starting all over on universal health care—and I wish we had universal health care! But I think we can get to it by building on Obamacare, and I love that that's Hillary's approach.
She wrote a book called Hard Choices. Boy, if I were in her position, I would find her choices that she had to deal with very hard. I come from an extremely liberal, progressive point of view. I was that way when I was young—and I still am that way. I think Hillary is in the same place. We are called upon to make hard choices all the time.
What's one thing you wish people knew about Hillary?
We hear from people, quote: ""I don't know if she's trustworthy."" Let me answer that by saying that her opponents, and people who are scared of her politically, have spent millions of dollars throwing mud at her. They do that because they hope some of it will stick. If you think she's untrustworthy, some of it has stuck! And I'm here to tell you that I know her, and I trust her to lead our country to the best possible place it can be. To help you achieve your dreams. To help us achieve our goals. To make a better world for my children and grandchildren and your grandchildren, if you're reading this.

College is a great investment—for individual students and for our economy. But it's also a severe expense that holds many Americans back well into adulthood.
About 70 percent of college graduates take out loans to finance their education. Across the country, Americans hold a staggering $1.2 trillion in student debt—the second highest source of consumer debt behind home mortgages. And that number continues to climb.
The graduating class of 2016 is slated to be the most indebted in U.S. history—and loan balances are disproportionately high for low-income students, including students of color.
So how does student debt really affect your bottom line in the long run? It's more than you might expect.
Among the class of 2014, the average undergraduate who took out loans borrowed just over $28,950. Paid back over 20 years at the unsubsidized federal loan rate, he or she would owe $186.00 per month.
Those payments—every month for two decades—really add up.
For instance:
If you put that money in a savings account, you'd have more than $11,000 saved in just five years.
If you invested that money in a mutual fund for 10 years, you could bank more than $27,000.
And if you put all of those monthly payments in a 401(k), you could have?$86,000 put aside for retirement in 20 years.
Source: smartasset.com (Assumes a 6% annual rate of return)
Studies suggest that student debt is holding back young people from life milestones like getting married, buying homes, having children, and starting small businesses.
And according to a 2013 study by the think tank Demos, college-educated households with student debt stand to lose $208,000 over a lifetime, mostly from a lack of retirement savings.
Education should hold the key to a brighter future—not a lifetime of debilitating debt.
That's why Hillary Clinton has released a plan for debt-free college. Under her plan, students won't have to take out loans to pay for tuition, books, or fees at four-year public colleges and universities in their states. Families will make an affordable, realistic contribution and students will do their part by working 10 hours a week to help pay for school.
Those with existing student debt will be able to refinance at a lower rate, which will give debt relief to an estimated 25 million borrowers. And Hillary's plan will allow everyone to enroll in an income-based repayment plan so that they're never spending more than 10 percent of their income on student loans.
"" We need to make a quality education affordable and available to everyone willing to work for it, without saddling them with decades of debt.""Hillary, August 10, 2015

When I announced that I would lead the effort to change the culture around mental health, to address stigma and the way our city delivers mental health services—a tough issue that has historically been ignored—Hillary was one of the first to express enthusiasm, and to offer me advice about how to make sure everyone is included in ThriveNYC. I wasn't surprised.
Hillary has always been able to see a problem clearly and create a plan to fix it. She has never been afraid to tackle a tough issue and stick with it until she finds a solution.
That's probably why, from the very beginning, Hillary recognized a truth that many would rather ignore: So many of the challenges facing American families are rooted in inequality. That is why, throughout her career, she has fought for policies that address the root causes of inequality.
The need for her leadership on this issue has never been more urgent, especially for African Americans. The typical African American family has just 8 cents of wealth for every dollar held by a typical white family. Eight cents. And it's even less for African American women.
That has to change—and it starts by fighting for equal pay. That is why Hillary, as senator, helped pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.
But equal pay is just a start. We also need to give hardworking Americans a raise.
Back in January, my husband, Mayor Bill de Blasio, announced a $15-dollar minimum wage for all city government employees. And on Monday, our state's minimum wage was raised to $15 dollars. Now we need other states to follow our lead.
And for that to happen, we need Hillary.
It is also high time for us to provide every American with access to paid sick leave and paid family leave. Because no one should be forced to choose between the health of their family and their next paycheck.
Doing that won't be easy. I know because we've already done it, extending paid family leave to 20,000 city employees and sick leave to a half-million more New Yorkers.
Now we need to make sure every family has access to these crucial resources. Doing that will take more than a vision. It will take a plan and meticulous follow up and execution.
And let's not forget early childhood education—a passion that Hillary and I have long shared. Universal pre-k is in its second year here in New York City, and I know that Hillary is eager to extend universal pre-kindergarten to the rest of the country.
Bill and I have been advocating for progressive change since we worked for New York City's first mayor of color, David Dinkins, in the early ?90s. So I know what progressive looks like—and it looks like Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In New York City, we have a bold vision to address inequality. And we have plans to make that vision a reality. Our city and our country would benefit greatly if we had a progressive president in the White House.
That is why we need Hillary. No one is better prepared to help us with our mission. No one is better prepared to help our working families.
She has what it takes—and she won't stop until the work is done.

500,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=70&campaign=2016CLINTON&doctype=5002,"April 10, 2016","Press Release - Hillary Clinton Went ""Off Message."" Here's What We Learned",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116840,Hillary Clinton,"Including an extremely astute take on flying.
Hillary Clinton recently sat down for a candid conversation about the 2016 election with journalist Glenn Thrush on POLITICO's ""Off Message"" podcast.
You can listen to the whole hourlong conversation here—but if you're short on time, check out these five key takeaways.
1. Hillary's philosophy about flying is a pretty good philosophy for living.
Thrush shared a memory from the press plane during Hillary's 2008 campaign: ""I was not a happy flier, and nothing ever seemed to bother you,"" he said. ""I mean, we were in some really hairy situations, and you would sleep your way through it.""
""That is the answer to everything,"" Hillary responded. ""When you're facing a difficult issue that you absolutely cannot do anything about—in this case, I can't fly the plane, I can't change the weather—falling asleep, you'll either wake up and things will be fine, or you won't. ... It's been my observation that so many people worry about things that they are either ruminating over the past, which doesn't help you get the focus and energy you need to get up every day and go forward, or they're worrying about stuff that they have absolutely no control over. So I have developed that kind of philosophy in my life over the years.""
2. She doesn't think she's a natural politician.
Hillary admits that campaigning is hard—and it didn't come naturally to her. Even something as seemingly simple as using the pronoun ""I"" was an adjustment. ""I'm very comfortable saying, you know, ?he,' ?she,' ?we,'"" Hillary said. ""But when I had to stand up in front of people and basically say, ?I'm asking for your vote, I'm telling you what I want to do,' that took years. It absolutely took years.""
But Hillary says while asking for a job is a challenge, she thrives on the job when she gets it. ""I am someone who loves doing the job that I have. I would love having the job of president because I know how to do it. I know what the country needs. But the campaigning part is hard for me. I think I've gotten better.""
3. She's a policy wonk—and proud of it.
""I really believe part of what this campaign has to do is rebuild people's faith in our national mission,"" Hillary said. ""How do we get the economy to work? How do we get the government to work? How do we get our political system to work? And I feel strongly that I owe people a clear set of ideas, and I want to lay those out.
""And I know that sometimes I get criticized for, ?Oh, my gosh, there she goes with another plan.' You know, ?Forget the plan, just, you know, do the rhetorical flourish.' I really believe that when this is all over—and I will have won, hopefully—in large measure it will be because I came out and told people, ?Here's what I want to do, here's how I think I can do it, here are the results I believe I can get, and I want you to hold me accountable for it.' I think that's what politics should be about, so I'm very comfortable doing that.""
Hillary's right—she does have a lot of plans. Explore them here.
4. She's ready to stand up to bullies—and that includes the Republican candidates for president.
Speaking about ""mean-spirited"" Republican candidates in this election, Hillary reflected: ""We can have differences. Look, I'm well-aware that it's a contact sport. I understand that. But when it gets right down to it, you've got to offer Americans your credentials, because it's a huge interviewing and hiring process. And people have to decide, ?What do I know about this person? Is this the person I want in the Oval Office? Is this the person I want to be both president and Commander-in-Chief?' And that requires a level of dialogue and debate that is civil, that does have a purpose to it other than just, you know, making a point.""
5. She's fighting to fix income inequality—and every other kind of inequality.
""I don't think any right that we have is less important than any other issue,"" Hillary said. ""You know, I have said repeatedly, ?I am going to attack income inequality,' and I think I have a pretty good plan to do so. I don't just tell you what I'm against. I tell you what I'm for and how I would do it.
""But there are other forms of inequality. There is desperate education inequality in America, and I think every kid deserves a good teacher and a good school regardless of the ZIP code that he or she lives in. Racial inequality, sexual orientation inequality, gender inequality. So when somebody says, ?Yeah, yeah, it's important, but let's talk about the really important issues. Don't let us get distracted from hearing the same thing we've heard now, over and over again about income inequality,' that bothers me, and I did speak out about it.""

Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands.
So nice, thank you very much. That's really nice. Thank you. It's great to be at Trump Tower. It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York. And it's an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody's expectations. There's been no crowd like this.
And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in. They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work. They sweated like dogs. [laughter]
They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS? I don't think it's gonna happen. [applause]
Our country is in serious trouble. We don't have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don't have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time. [applause]
Audience Member: We want Trump. We want Trump.
Trump: When did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time.
When do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they're killing us economically.
The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems. [applause]
Thank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.
But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They're sending us not the right people.
It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably — probably — from the Middle East. But we don't know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening. And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast. [applause]
Trump: Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East. They've become rich. I'm in competition with them.
They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.
So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has. And in 19 — and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said — and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever. But I said, ""Don't hit Iraq,"" because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love — they're great — all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.
And we have nothing. We can't even go there. We have nothing. And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees — these are big vehicles — were left behind for the enemy. 2,000? You would say maybe two, maybe four? 2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
Audience Member: We need Trump now.
Trump: You're right. [applause]
Audience Member: We need Trump now.
Trump: Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product — a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Whoever heard of this? It's never below zero.
Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it.
That's right. A lot of people up there can't get jobs. They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have jobs.
But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
Audience Member: We want Trump now.
Trump: Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.
It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked. And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, ""That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue. They don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing.""
Audience Member: We need Trump now. [applause]
Trump: We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Obamacare.
Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless. It's virtually useless. It is a disaster.
Trump: And remember the $5 billion Web site? $5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work. A $5 billion Web site.
I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a Web site. It costs me $3. $5 billion Web site. [applause]
Audience: We want Trump. We want Trump. We want Trump. We want Trump.
Trump: Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. Nothing's gonna get done. They will not bring us — believe me — to the promised land. They will not.
As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans. And they're wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to support them. They don't know how to bring it about. They come up to my office. I'm meeting with three of them in the next week. And they don't know — ""Are you running? Are you not running? Could we have your support? What do we do? How do we do it?""
I like them. And I hear their speeches. And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China. When was the last time you heard China is killing us? They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe. It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible. They're killing us.
But you don't hear that from anybody else. You don't hear it from anybody else. And I watch the speeches.
Audience Member: No more free [inaudible].
Trump: Thank you.
I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. And people are saying, ""What's going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I don't need the rhetoric. I want a job.""
And that's what's happening. And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016. Obama is going to be out playing golf. He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to — I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he'd like to play, that's fine. [applause]
In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing. [laughter]
But Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, ""Donald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It's a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good. They have no plan now.""
We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be — and — and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody. But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it. [applause]
Audience: Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump.
Trump: So I've watched the politicians. I've dealt with them all my life. If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you. You're certainly not very good. And that's what we have representing us. They will never make America great again. They don't even have a chance. They're controlled fully — they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
Yes, they control them. Hey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They're great. But you know what? It won't happen. It won't happen. Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country. We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
Audience: It needs Trump.
Trump: Now, our country needs — our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote ""The Art of the Deal.""
Audience Member: Yes.
Trump: We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned. [applause]
And we also need a cheerleader.
You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, ""Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well. I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country. I think he'd be a great spirit.""
He was vibrant. He was young. I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
Audience Member: But not a leader.
Trump: He's not a leader. That's true. You're right about that.
But he wasn't a cheerleader. He's actually a negative force. He's been a negative force. He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again. It's not great again. [applause]
We need — we need somebody — we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that. [applause]
And, I will tell you, I love my life. I have a wonderful family. They're saying, ""Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough.""
You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office. Just can't happen. And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
So ladies and gentlemen... [applause]
I am officially running...[applause]... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again. [applause]
It can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people.
We have people that aren't working. We have people that have no incentive to work. But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job. And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be — they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving. It can happen. [applause]
I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that. [applause]
I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.
Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion. We owe Japan more than that. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.
How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they? [applause]
I'm going to tell you — thank you. I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.
Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue. Our president doesn't have a clue. He's a bad negotiator.
He's the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
We get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That's the negotiator we have.
Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long. It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel. But...
Audience Member: Yes, we do. Yes, we do. [applause]
Trump: So we need people — I'm a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren't smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests. And it's just not going to work.
So, here's a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it. I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything — everything, they got away with it again. And it's impossible for our people here to compete.
So I want to tell you this story. A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago. He's very upset. I said, ""What's your problem?""
He said, ""You know, I make great product.""
And I said, ""I know. I know that because I buy the product.""
He said, ""I can't get it into China. They won't accept it. I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it.""
I said, ""Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible. Does anyone know this?""
He said, ""Yeah, they do it all the time with other people.""
I said, ""They send it back?""
""Yeah. So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff. They're not supposed to be doing that. I told them.""
Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
Ask Boeing. They wanted Boeing's secrets. They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.
Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for — I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war. Very valuable.
I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. People say, ""Oh, you don't like China?""
No, I love them. But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that. There's too much — it's like — it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
They are ripping us. We are rebuilding China. We're rebuilding many countries. China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes. And they're all over the place.
We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them. We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game. We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
Now they're going militarily. They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea. A military island. Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country — we would never build in an ocean. They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
They're building up their military to a point that is very scary. You have a problem with ISIS. You have a bigger problem with China.
And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
So this man tells me about the manufacturing. I say, ""That's a terrible story. I hate to hear it.""
But I have another one, Ford.
So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out. Everybody thought the deal was dead. Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee. Great state, great people.
All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee. They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead. Not good.
Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. $2.5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world. Ford. Good company.
So I announced that I'm running for president. I would... [applause]
... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in — and I wouldn't even use — you know, I have — I know the smartest negotiators in the world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones.
You get a lot of them that are overrated. They're not good. They think they are. They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph). But they're not good.
But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country. Believe me, folks. We will do very, very well, very, very well.
But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one. I would call up the head of Ford, who I know. If I was president, I'd say, ""Congratulations. I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border.""
And you say to yourself, ""How does that help us,"" right? ""How does that help us? Where is that good""? It's not.
So I would say, ""Congratulations. That's the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.
Now, here's what is going to happen. If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're [inaudible]. And here's what's going to happen. They're not so stupid. They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, ""You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford.""
And guess what? No problem. They're going to build in Mexico. They're going to take away thousands of jobs. It's very bad for us.
So under President Trump, here's what would happen: [applause]
The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news. But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day. You know, they want to be a little cool.
And he'll say, ""Please, please, please."" He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, ""No interest."" Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, ""Sorry, fellas. No interest,"" because I don't need anybody's money. It's nice. I don't need anybody's money.
I'm using my own money. I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using donors. I don't care. I'm really rich. I [inaudible]...[applause]
And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a — that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.
Audience Member: Absolutely.
Trump: So — because we got to make the country rich.
It sounds crass. Somebody said, ""Oh, that's crass."" It's not crass.
We got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems.
We got a military that needs equipment all over the place. We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
We've got nothing. We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it. [applause]
But here's what's going to happen:
After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the — the donors and by the lobbyists — and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero — I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford. He'll say. ""Please reconsider,"" I'll say no.
He'll say, ""Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico."" That's it. They have no choice. They have no choice.
There are hundreds of things like that. I'll give you another example.
Trump: Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships. We say ""we're gonna protect."" What are we doing? They've got nothing but money.
If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune. They wouldn't be there except for us.
And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory. Two weeks later, the place was blown up. Everybody got out — and they kept our equipment.
They always keep our equipment. We ought to send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment. We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be — we ought to send our surplus. We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
But look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone. They're gone.
And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq. You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now — it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run. I'm running. [applause]
But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate. I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq. He couldn't answer the question. He didn't know. I said, ""Is he intelligent?""
Then I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing? He didn't know. He couldn't answer the question.
How are these people gonna lead us? How are we gonna — how are we gonna go back and make it great again? We can't. They don't have a clue. They can't lead us. They can't. They can't even answer simple questions. It was terrible.
But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders. They were smarter than our leaders.
There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again. Because we need money. We're dying. We're dying. We need money. We have to do it. And we need the right people.
So Ford will come back. They'll all come back. And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
Audience Member: Yes.
Trump: Somebody said — thank you, darlin'. [applause]
Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, ""But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person.""
Audience Member: We don't need nice.
Trump: That's true. But actually I am. I think I am a nice person. People that know me, like me. Does my family like me? I think so, right. Look at my family. I'm proud of my family. [applause]
By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job. Did she do a great job? [applause]
Great. Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family. They're a great family. [applause]
So the reporter said to me the other day, ""But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person. How can you get people to vote for you?""
I said, ""I don't know."" I said, ""I think that number one, I am a nice person. I give a lot of money away to charities and other things. I think I'm actually a very nice person.""
But, I said, ""This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people. And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world. And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like third world countries. But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do. I'll do it. Because a lot of people said, ""He'll never run. Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle.""
Trump: They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth. And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
So I said, ""That's OK."" I'm proud of my net worth. I've done an amazing job.
I started off — thank you — I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said — and I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot.
But he used to say, ""Donald, don't go into Manhattan. That's the big leagues. We don't know anything about that. Don't do it.""
I said, ""I gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I've gotta do it.""
And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals — the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, ""Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks.""
So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success. I really am. [applause]
I've employed — I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical. That means education. That means everything.
So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary. But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything. We'll be filing it right on time. We don't need anything. [applause]
And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, ""He had assets of $9 billion."" So I said (ph), ""No, that's the wrong number. That's the wrong number. Not assets.""
So they put together this. And before I say it, I have to say this. I made it the old-fashioned way. It's real estate. You know, it's real estate.
It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.
And I have assets — big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected — 9 billion 240 million dollars.
Audience Member: Yeah.
Trump: And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph). That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.
In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, ""Donald, you don't have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion""? I said, ""I don't need it. I don't want it. And I've been there. I don't want it.""
But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted. So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion. But here, a total net worth of — net worth, not assets, not — a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets — Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York — many other places all over the world.
So the total is $8,737,540,00.
Now I'm not doing that... [applause]
I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don't have to brag. I don't have to, believe it or not.
I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs. We need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking.
We have losers. We have losers. We have people that don't have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years — you know, we're at $8 trillion now. We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
According to the economists — who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying — that $24 trillion — we're very close — that's the point of no return. $24 trillion. We will be there soon. That's when we become Greece. That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable. And we're gonna be there very soon. We're gonna be there very soon.
Audience Member: Make America strong.
Trump: So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly. I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
Audience Member: Yeah. [applause]
I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.
Audience Member: Yes.
Trump: Mark my words. [applause]
Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody. [applause]
I will find — within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
Audience Member: Yes. [applause]
Trump: I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg. I won't be doing that. And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you. [applause]
I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately. [applause]
Fully support and back up the Second Amendment. [applause]
Now, it's very interesting. Today I heard it. Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are. And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, ""You know, Mr. Trump,"" and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, ""You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns. I didn't want guns. And now since this happened"" — it's up in the prison area — ""my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns. We now have a gun on every table. We're ready to start shooting.""
I said, ""Very interesting.""
So protect the Second Amendment. [applause]
End — end Common Core. Common Core should — it is a disaster. Bush is totally in favor of Common Core. I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination. He's weak on immigration. He's in favor of Common Core. How the hell can you vote for this guy? You just can't do it. We have to end — education has to be local.
Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
Audience Member: Yeah.
Trump: Nobody can do that like me. Believe me. It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.
I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third. What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels. It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington. The Obama administration. We got it. It was the most highly sought after — or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services. We got it. People were shocked, Trump got it.
Well, I got it for two reasons. Number one, we're really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement. Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job. And they wanted to make sure it got built.
Trump: So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country. You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor. They throw down asphalt, and they throw.
You look at these airports, we are like a third world country. And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world. You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster. You have all of these disastrous airports. We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it. [applause]
Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have been paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.
Audience Member: Yes. [applause]
Trump: Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated.
Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful.
And strengthen our military and take care of our vets. So, so important.
Audience Member: Yes. [applause]
Trump: Sadly, the American dream is dead.
Audience Member: Bring it back.
Trump: But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
Thank you. Thank you very much. [applause]

513,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=115&campaign=2016TRUMP&doctype=5000,"March 21, 2016","Remarks at the AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington, DC",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116597,Donald Trump,"Good evening. Thank you very much. I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel. I'm a newcomer to politics, but not to backing the Jewish state.
In 2001, weeks after the attacks on New York City and on Washington and frankly, the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated and they were perpetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists, Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims. I sent my plane, because I backed the mission for Israel 100 percent.
In spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the grand marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel parade, the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state. It was a very dangerous time for Israel, and frankly, for anyone supporting Israel. Many people turned down this honor; I did not. I took the risk and I'm glad I did.
But I didn't come here tonight to pander to you about Israel. That's what politicians do, all talk, no action, believe me. I came here to speak to you about where I stand on the future of American relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship and our cultural brother, the only democracy in the Middle East, the State of Israel.
Thank you. My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. Thank you. I have been in business a long time, I know deal making and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic for America, for Israel and for the whole of the Middle East.
The problem here is fundamental. We've rewarded the world's leading state sponsor of terror with 150 billion dollars and we received absolutely nothing in return. I've studied this issue in great detail. I would say, actually, greater by far than anybody else, believe me, oh, believe me.
And it's a bad deal. The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it, because already as you know, it has. The bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. And of course, they'll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them.
The deal doesn't even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability. Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years, but when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-sized military nuclear capability ready to go and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad Iran's behavior is. Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, and especially Israel.
When I'm president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. First, we will stand up to Iran's aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region.
Iran is a very big problem and will continue to be, but if I'm not elected president, I know how to deal with trouble, and believe me, that's why I'm going to be elected president, folks. And we are leading in every poll, remember that, please.
Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. Literally, every day Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states, Hezbollah, Lebanon received, and I'll tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons and GPS systems and rockets like very few people anywhere in the world and certainly very few countries have.
Now they're in Syria trying to establish another front against Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. In Gaza, Iran is supporting Hamas, and Islamic Jihad. And in the West Bank, they're openly offering Palestinians 7,000 dollars per terror attack and 30,000 dollars for every Palestinian terrorist home that's been destroyed, a deplorable, deplorable situation.
Iran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East and it's absolutely incredible that we handed them over 150 billion dollars to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror.
Secondly, we will totally dismantle Iran's global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us.
Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world. During the last five years, Iran has perpetuated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents. They've got terror cells everywhere, including in the Western Hemisphere very close to home. Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me.
Third, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal to hold Iran totally accountable and we will enforce it like you've never seen a contract enforced before, folks, believe me.
Iran has already, since the deal is in place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times. Those ballistic missiles, with a range of 1,250 miles, were designed to intimidate not only Israel, which is only 600 miles away, but also intended to frighten Europe and someday maybe hit even the United States and we're not going to let that happen, we're not letting it happen and we're not letting it happen to Israel, believe me.
Thank you. Do you want to hear something really shocking? As many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles in both Hebrew and Farsi were the words ""Israel must be wiped off the face of the earth."" You can forget that.
What kind of demented minds write that in Hebrew? And here's another. You talk about twisted, here's another twisted part. Testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we've made. The deal is silent on test missiles, but those tests do violate the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The problem is, no one has done anything about it. We will, I promise, we will.
Thank you. Which brings me to my next point, the utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations. The United Nations is not a friend of democracy, it's not a friend to freedom, it's not a friend even to the United States of America; whereas you know it has its home and it surely is not a friend to Israel.
With President Obama, in his final year, yay, he may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel, believe me, believe me, and you know it better than anybody. So with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a security council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between Israel and Palestine. Let me be clear, an agreement imposed by the United Nations would be a total and complete disaster.
The United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which I will use as president 100 percent.
When people ask why, it's because that's not how you make a deal. Deals are made when parties come together, they come to a table and they negotiate. Each side must give up something, its values. I mean, we have to do something where there's value in exchange for something that it requires. That's what a deal is.
A deal is really something that when we impose it on Israel and Palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something. That's not going to happen with the United Nations. It will only further, very importantly, it will only further delegitimize Israel. It will be a catastrophe and a disaster for Israel. It's not going to happen, folks.
And further, it would reward Palestinian terrorism, because every day they're stabbing Israelis and even Americans. Just last week, American Taylor Allen Force, a West Point grad, phenomenal young person who served in Iraq and Afghanistan was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian. You don't reward behavior like that. You cannot do it. There's only one way you treat that kind of behavior. You have to confront it.
So it's not up to the United Nations to really go with a solution. It's really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves. They have no choice, they have to do it themselves or it will never hold up anyway. The United States can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations, but no one should be telling Israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don't even really know what's happening to Israel, to anything in the area. It's so preposterous. We're not going to let that happen.
When I'm president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the U.N. to impose its will on the Jewish state. It will be vetoed 100 percent.
You see, I know about deal making, that's what I do. I wrote the Art of the Deal. One of the bestselling all-time, and I mean, seriously, I'm saying ""one of,"" because I'll be criticized if I say ""the,"" so I'm going to be very diplomatic, ""one of,"" I'll be criticized, I think it is
number one, but why take a chance. One of the all-time bestselling books about deals and deal making.
To make a great deal, you need two willing participants. We know Israel is willing to deal. Israel has been trying.
That's right. Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years. You had Camp David in 2000 where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous; Arafat rejected it. In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert made an equally generous offer; the Palestinian Authority rejected it also.
Then John Kerry tried to come up with the framework and Abbas didn't even respond, not even to the Secretary of State of the United States of America. They didn't even respond. When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one.
Thank you. And when I say something, I mean it.
I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately. I have known him for many years and we'll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region. Meanwhile, every single day you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate Israel and to hate the Jews. It has to stop.
When you live in a society where the firefighters are the heroes, little kids want to be firefighters. When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars. In Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews. We can't let this continue. We can't let this happen any longer.
You cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs. Glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace. It is a horrible way to think. It's a barrier that can't be broken. That will end and it'll end soon, believe me. In Palestinian textbooks and mosques, you've got a culture of hatred that has been fomenting there for years and if we want to achieve peace, they've got to go out and they've got to start [sic] this educational process. They have to end education of hatred. They have to end it and now.
There is no moral equivalency. Israel does not name public squares after terrorists. Israel does not pay its children to stab random Palestinians. You see, what President Obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies.
And you see that happening all the time, that pattern practiced by the president and his administration, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is a total disaster, by the way. She and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly.
But it's repeated itself over and over again and it's done nothing to embolden those who hate America. We saw that with releasing the 150 billion dollars to Iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community. It didn't happen.
President Obama thinks that applying pressure to Israel will force the issue, but it's precisely the opposite that happens. Already half of the population of Palestine has been taken over by the Palestinian ISIS in Hamas and the other half refuses to confront the first half. So it's a very difficult situation that's never going to get solved unless you have great leadership right here in the United States. We'll get it solved one way or the other. We will get it solved.
But when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise and rises exponentially. That's what will happen when Donald Trump is president of the United States.
We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the State of Israel.
The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely totally unbreakable. They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel. They must do that.
And they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish state and it will forever exist as a Jewish state.
I love the people in this room. I love Israel. I love Israel. I've been with Israel so long in terms of I've received some of my greatest honors from Israel; my father before me, incredible. My daughter Ivanka is about to have a beautiful Jewish baby. In fact, it could be happening right now, which would be very nice as far as I'm concerned.
So I want to thank you very much, this has been a truly great honor. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Donald J. Trump Response to Hillary Clinton
(New York, NY) July 14, 2015 — Today Donald J. Trump released the following statement as a response to Hillary Clinton.
Failing candidate Hillary Clinton, who is desperately trying to hold on to her lead in the democratic primary against Bernie Sanders, is knowingly putting out lies about my stance on illegal immigration. I said ""Mexico is sending""--- I'm not knocking immigration or immigrants, but rather am very critical of the country of Mexico for sending us people that they don't want. Likewise I am very critical of illegal immigration and the tremendous problems including crime, which it causes.
She is desperate, she is sad, and she is obviously very nervous when she has to revert to issues that have already been settled given the absolute accuracy of my statement. She speaks about ""my tone"" and that's the problem with our country's leaders. They are more worried about tone than results! It's not about being nice--- it's about being competent.
Hillary should spend more time producing her illegally hidden emails and less time trying to obfuscate a statement by me that is totally clear and obviously very much accepted by the public as true. I am honored, however, that she is attacking me, instead of Jeb Bush. Obviously she knows that JEB is no longer her real competition. The last person she wants to face is Donald Trump.

Donald J. Trump Statement on Iran Agreement
(New York, NY) July 14, 2015 — Today Donald J. Trump released the following statement in response to the Obama Administration's agreement with Iran.
The Obama Administration's agreement with Iran is very dangerous. Iran developing a nuclear weapon, either through uranium or nuclear fuel, and defying the world is still a very real possibility. The inspections will not be followed, and Iran will no longer have any sanctions. Iran gets everything and loses nothing.
Every promise the Obama Administration made in the beginning of negotiations, including the vow (made at the beginning of the negotiations) to get our great American prisoners returned to the U. S. has been broken. This is a bad deal that sets a dangerous precedent.
This deal sets off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, which is the most-unstable region in the world. It is a horrible and perhaps catastrophic event for Israel.
Furthermore, we should have kept the billions of dollars we have agreed to pay them. Any great dealmaker would know this is a perfect example of ""tapping along"" and because they have been unchecked for so long throughout this extremely lengthy process, I guarantee they are much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than they were at the start of negotiations.
The fact is, the US has incompetent leaders and even more incompetent negotiators. We must do better for America and the world. We have to Make America Great Again.

Trump on Veterans Day,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=113921,Donald Trump,"November is a great month for Americans. In New York City, we get to look out on Central Park and see the leaves change as we move from the beauty of Fall to a magnificent city cloaked in the chill and briskness of Winter. What we Americans often gloss over is that November is a time for celebrating the very reason we enjoy the freedom, opportunity and prosperity found nowhere else in the world. The reason we are able to live like we do is due to the courage, dedication and sacrifice of those who serve in the armed forces of the United States and to those who have given the last full measure.
This November we should pay particular attention to the world situation. All over the world, young men and women who have volunteered to serve this nation are standing watch to protect us from the evil that is focused on taking away all that we value. We have turmoil in the Middle East, unrest in Europe, aggressive expansion in the Pacific Rim and stateless terrorism that threatens every aspect of freedom all across the globe. At no time in history have things been so precarious. Yet, we are able to find the best among us to step forward and take on the traditions and values of generations past, humbly putting on the uniform of this nation. They do so to support and defend the Constitution, not the President, the Congress or even the flag. They swear to defend an idea and an ideal. As is so subtly stated in the Preamble of our Founding Document, they take on the task ""to secure Liberty for ourselves and our posterity.""
On November 10th, the Marine Corps celebrated its 240th birthday. The Marines were, are and will remain unique in the world, a force that is first to fight and last to come home. The Marines have maintained the highest standards and ""once a Marine, always a Marine,"" captures the sense of duty and honor that permeates every pore of those who have worn the Eagle, Globe and Anchor.
Today, we honor all veterans who are and have served in the armed forces. This day has special meaning to so many. Over the years, I have hired thousands of veterans and have found them to be among the very best. They bring no attention to themselves except in their extraordinary professionalism and dedication to whatever they choose to do. Quietly, humbly, and without fanfare, they go about their daily lives being great citizens, good moms and dads, and loving, devoted companions. Bearing up under the terrible damage of war, so many carry on with dignity and grace. We should be so proud of them and we should honor them every day. November is also the month we celebrate the Military Family. Too many of us have never had to be away from family and friends on holidays, birthdays and anniversaries. We have never been asked to risk life and limb in places we cannot even find on a map. We go about our daily lives enjoying freedom, most of the time without ever thinking about what it is like to have a loved one in harm's way. The sacrifice and strength of military families, those who also serve, is so important to morale and welfare of those so far from home.
I have lived a full life and have benefited more than most from the opportunities found in this country. I have a loving, healthy family and I am running for President -- only in America. To be where I am, I thank God every day for those who stand on the ramparts of liberty with courage, strength, humility and dignity. So, this November, let's celebrate our veterans and their families and keep them in our prayers. Because of these dedicated Americans, we will be able to Make America Great Again!

Trump Statement on Preventing Muslim Immigration,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=113841,Donald Trump,"(New York, NY) December 7th, 2015, -- Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on. According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing ""25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad"" and 51% of those polled, ""agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah."" Shariah authorizes such atrocities as murder against non-believers who won't convert, beheadings and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans, especially women.
Mr. Trump stated, ""Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. If I win the election for President, we are going to Make America Great Again."" - Donald J. Trump

I am proud to share this report, written by the highly respected Dr. Harold Bornstein of Lenox Hill Hospital, stating that I am in excellent health. I am fortunate to have been blessed with great genes --- both of my parents had very long and productive lives.

In order to avoid a government shutdown, a cowardly threat from an incompetent President, the elected Republicans in Congress threw in the towel and showed absolutely no budget discipline.
The American people will have to absorb higher deficits, greater debt, less economic liberty and more corporate welfare. Congress cannot seem to help itself in bending to every whim of special interests. How can they face their constituents when they continue to burden our children and grandchildren with debts they will never be able to repay? Our government is failing us, so we must do something about it. Who knows how bad things will be when the next administration comes in and has to pick up the pieces?
The only special interest not being served by our government is the American people. It is time we imposed budget discipline by holding the line on spending, getting rid of waste, fraud and abuse, and by taking on our debt. To do these things, we need a President who can lead the fight to hold Congress and the rest of government accountable. Together, we can Make America Great Again."" — Donald J. Trump

Justice Scalia was a remarkable person and a brilliant Supreme Court Justice, one of the best of all time. His career was defined by his reverence for the Constitution and his legacy of protecting Americans' most cherished freedoms. He was a Justice who did not believe in legislating from the bench and he is a person whom I held in the highest regard and will always greatly respect his intelligence and conviction to uphold the Constitution of our country. My thoughts and prayers are with his family during this time."

He is the single biggest liar I've ever come across, in politics or otherwise, and I have seen some of the best of them. His statements are totally untrue and completely outrageous. It is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much.
Cruz said I would be appointing a liberal judge when in fact I will appoint a great conservative and I am the only candidate who has gone so far, at the debate, as to suggest two individuals I feel would best represent the conservative values we need to protect: William ""Bill"" Pryor Jr. and Diane Sykes.
Cruz says I am pro-choice, when in fact I am staunchly pro-life and have been for a long time. Like Ronald Reagan, on many issues, I have evolved.
Cruz says I am in favor of ObamaCare, when in fact I have spoken about repealing and replacing this disaster of a system at every speech throughout my campaign and since it's inception. Meanwhile, Cruz was responsible for getting Bush to put in the judge that failed to vote against ObamaCare twice.
Cruz says I will try to take away your second amendment rights, when I am one of the strongest proponents of the right to bear arms and I say so in every speech that I have made for years. I am a proud member of the NRA and so are my sons.
Cruz has become unhinged and is lying with the hopes that his statements will go unchecked until after the election and he will save his failing campaign.
In Iowa, Cruz told thousands of Ben Carson voters that Dr. Carson had left the race and to instead vote for Ted Cruz. He apologized when the race was over. Likewise, his fraudulent voter violation form sent to Iowa voters. If Ted is going to continue to lie with such desperation, I have no choice but to fight back.
One of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore cannot be President. If he doesn't take down his false ads and retract his lies, I will do so immediately. Additionally, the RNC should intervene and if they don't they are in default of their pledge to me.
I am the strongest on the borders and I will build a wall, and it will be a real wall. I am strongest on illegal immigration, strongest on ISIS, strongest on the military and I will take care of our Vets. I will end common core and preserve the second amendment. I will renegotiate our trade deals and bring our jobs back to our country. I am the only person who will Make America Great Again.

The Mexican government and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the Pope, because they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them. The Pope only heard one side of the story - he didn't see the crime, the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the United States. He doesn't see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation.
For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful. I am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current President. No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man's religion or faith.

The biggest beneficiaries of allowing fewer foreign workers into our country would be minority workers, including all immigrants now living here, who are competing for jobs, benefits and community resources against record waves of foreign workers. Limiting job competition would reopen pathways to middle-class stability and shrink welfare rolls. In addition, it would relieve overcrowding in our schools and hospitals that afflict our poorest communities. Yet, Senators Cruz and Rubio have led the charge for even higher immigration rates - a policy supported by only 7 percent of the Republican electorate.

This endorsement represents a total rejection of the corrupt politicians who have allowed transnational gangs and cartels to terrorize American communities.
The National Border Patrol Council is the official body representing America's front-line Border Patrol Agents who sacrifice every day, under intolerable political restraints, to keep America safe. America's 16,500 border patrol agents represented by the NBPC are the first line of defense for our nation. The NBPC provides the vital outlet to learn the truth - not the political spin from bureaucrats - about what is really happening on our border. And the NBPC has been the one outlet these agents have to prevent their voice from being drowned out by big money special interests.
As President, I will work tirelessly with the NBPC and their rank-and-file agents to secure our border once and for all. I will ensure that every rank-and-file officer has the resources, tools and support they need to protect this nation and stop the influx of drugs, gangs and cartel violence. Together, we will save thousands of American lives, millions of American jobs, and billions of American tax dollars.
I am deeply privileged to have the official support of America's border patrol agents, and will never let them down.
This is our chance to make our country safe again, and ultimately, Make America Great Again.""

Donald J. Trump said, ""Quite simply, it is time to bring real leadership to Washington. The fact is, the American Dream is dead -- but if I win, I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before. Together we will Make America Great Again!""

Following the lead of several candidates in the 2016 presidential race, Donald Trump traveled to New Hampshire the day after announcing his candidacy.
Trump spoke for more than an hour at the rally on Manchester Community College. He said politicians are all talk and no action.
""The American Dream is dead, but we will bring it back bigger and stronger and more powerfully than ever before,"" Trump said.
In his first New Hampshire event since announcing his campaign for the Republican nomination for president on Tuesday, Trump dismissed critics who thought he wouldn't run.
""'Why would he run? He's got this great lifestyle, he's got this wonderful business, wonderful family, why would he do that?' Because I want to make our country wonderful,"" Trump said.
He is taking a hard line on illegal immigration, so hard that protesters showed up at this event, some holding signs that said ""Mexicans are people, not criminals.""
""Mexicans, I love Mexicans, they're great. I have so many friends, Mexicans,"" Trump said. ""But the people that are coming into our country are, in many cases brutal.""
While other White House hopefuls might try to avoid such controversy, Rep. Steve Stepanek, R-Milford, said Trump is an outside-the-box candidate who doesn't care what the national media thinks.
""It's what the average person on Main Street thinks,"" Stepanek said. ""And they're warming up to him.""
As Trump navigated a crush of admirers and reporters after his speech, News 9 asked the multi-billionaire how much of his own money he would be willing to spend to win.
""Many, many millions of dollars,"" Trump said.

Today, Donald J. Trump is calling for the immediate resignation of Club for Growth President David McIntosh after a failed attempt to secure $1 million dollars from Mr. Trump.In calling for Mr. McIntosh's immediate resignation, Mr. Trump says, ""I am appalled by Mr. McIntosh's shameless pandering and blatant shakedown attempt, exposing him and the Club for Growth as a fraud.""
Mr. McIntosh met with Mr. Trump and his representatives in New York City at Trump Tower on May 26th. During that meeting he praised Mr. Trump for his business success and talked about the need for someone like Mr. Trump to be in Washington, D.C. He then talked about the Club for Growth and what it is doing. The meeting lasted approximately 30 minutes.
One week later, Mr. Trump and political advisor Corey Lewandowski (now campaign manager) received letters (attached) from Mr. McIntosh requesting $1 million dollars of financial support for the Club for Growth. The letter to Mr. Trump states, ""As we both know, it is business owners who create jobs- not the government.""
Less than fourteen days after sending his request for the $1 million, and after Mr. Trump did not give money to the Club for Growth and instead declared his candidacy, Mr. McIntosh attacked Mr. Trump, was critical of his candidacy, and said, ""It would be unfortunate if (Mr. Trump) takes away a spot at even one Republican debate.""
Lewandowski stated, ""The Club for Growth is the worst of the two-faced hypocrisy of Washington.""
This exemplifies everything that is wrong with politics in our country. Club for Growth claims to fight for conservative causes and support Republican candidates who oppose politics as usual, and apparently will say anything in an effort to raise funds. This unfortunate incident is representative of the corruption that persists in Washington, D.C., and politics in general, in the United States.

(Bluffton, SC) June 18, 2015- Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump today announced that he is postponing his scheduled visit to the Lowcountry of South Carolina due to the ""shockingly sad"" events that occurred in Charleston.
""The tragic events that occurred on Wednesday evening should be our nation's primary focus for the foreseeable future,"" stated Mr. Trump. ""This is a time for healing, not politics.""
Mr. Trump, who announced his candidacy for President on Tuesday in New York, is in the midst of a multi-state tour that includes stops in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. He was scheduled to appear before a capacity crowd in the residential community of Sun City in Bluffton, South Carolina.
""I look forward to returning to South Carolina and continuing our discussion on how we can best move our country forward,"" said Trump. ""Until that time our prayers and deepest condolences are with the people of Charleston and the families of those who have been torn apart by this senseless act of violence and hate.""
The Trump campaign announced that the South Carolina event will be rescheduled in the near future.

""People who think he's a joke and a fool need to be careful because by the end of the campaign, the joke may be on them."" That's how Joe Scarborough summed up the surprisingly respectful analysis of Donald Trump's candidacy on today's Morning Joe.
Introducing the segment, Scarborough suggested that if Trump sticks to a Perot-like populist message, he could get 15% of the primary vote. When Joe turned to Steve Schmidt, this NewsBuster expected the former McCain campaign manager and establishment Republican to dump on Trump. But to the contrary, Schmidt agreed heartily with Joe and went on to make the case that Trump is channeling widespread popular resentment, is the man people would want to hear in a debate, and could be ""very impactful"" in the race. John Heilemann was similarly respectful of Trump's potential, saying he ""doesn't play by the rules and is fearless,"" and receives serious, generally favorable local coverage in places like Iowa and New Hampshire.

Sunday on Fox News Channel's ""MediaBuzz,"" Republican presidential candidate and billionaire business mogul Donald Trump addressed his controversial comments on some Mexican immigrants being rapist and murderers said he was simply commenting on media reports on border crime, therefore he ""can never apologize for the truth.""
Host Howard Kurtz asked if he should apologize.
Trump replied, ""I don't have to say that. Look, the Mexican border is a sieve. People are pouring into our country. We don't know who they are, where they are, they come from all over the world, not just Mexicans. I employ thousands of Mexicans. I've employed over the years many thousands of Mexicans. I love the Mexican people. They're fantastic. Everybody knows that. In terms of the border, it's a disgrace. either we have a border or we don't have a country. You can't have a country without borders. People are coming in and some of those people — I read it even yesterday there was a huge article about the tremendous crime that's taking place. It's like a crime wave. One of the most dangerous places on earth. And I bring that up all of a sudden I'm a bad person.""
""I read an article yesterday from ""Fusion"" which is owned by Univision talking about women that cross the border are being raped. Many of them, a tremendous percentage, 80 percent, that's hard to believe it could be 80% they said the women coming across the border are raped. This is done by ""Fusion"" printed in ""The Huffington Post"" no friend of mine and I use the word rape and all of a sudden everyone goes crazy. It says 80% of the women — which hard to believe to be honest with you — so I can never apologize for the truth. I don't mind apologizing for things. I can't apologize for the truth. I said tremendous crime is coming across. Everybody knows that's true. It's happening all the time. When I mention crime, I'm a racist? I'm not a racist. I don't have a racist bone in my body. ""

Coulter said, ""I notice we've been warned all week watch out for ISIS, watch out for ISIS this weekend, and no, instead Americans were killed by [illegal] immigrants. This wasn't the only illegal immigrant, and it doesn't have to be limited to illegal immigrants, the government is allowing people who have no right to be here into our country, whether legally or illegally. There was also an illegal immigrant who hammered his wife to death in Texas over the weekend, you know, that was an illegal alien wife who was killed. So, it isn't just American citizens who aren't being protected, but these republicans and, of course, democrats who claim to speak for oh the poor, the downtrodden, the working class. No, they're speaking for big business who want their cheap labor and they'll externalize their costs, both in terms of taxes and in terms of the crime rate."" And ""You hear Republicans saying, 'well' — and Democrats, 'Well, of course, no one wants felons in this country.' Well, what are they doing to stop it? Chris Christie was on Fox News this weekend saying, you know, telling us once again that fences just don't work, the human spirit will overcome them. It's like saying buckets don't work. Of course fences work. Americans aren't stupid. Why doesn't Chris Christie say that to Israel or China? Because their fences work just fine.""
She added, ""the media are always hiding that these are immigrants, sometimes illegal, sometimes not illegal, who are committing a lot of these heinous crimes. It's always 'North Carolina Man Indicted on Child Rape.' So, frankly, we don't know after this weekend exactly how many Americans were killed by immigrants in drunk driving accidents, in heinous murders like this one in San Francisco. It'll take a few weeks, maybe a year to wait for the court transcripts for the media to even tell us the truth. The government won't tell us the truth. The media won't tell us the truth. But, the people in America know what the truth is. Unfortunately, the Chamber of Commerce and the Wall Street Journal don't. And most of these Republicans are busy sucking up to the rich and don't care about the workers. You know, I am sick of this nonsense about Donald Trump being the racist here. He's the one who was speaking for working class Americans, for African-Americans. How about — have you seen the black teenaged unemployment rate? Why shouldn't they be getting those jobs? It's Donald Trump who is speaking up for them. And boy, don't think Republican voters aren't keeping a list of who's naughty and nice on denouncing or praising Donald Trump right now.""
Coulter also talked about the 2016 presidential race, stating that ""Now I have a new soft spot in my heart for Sen. Ted Cruz. We always knew he was smart. He's been bad on legal immigration, in the past he wanted to triple what even Rubio wanted. But, he seems to have burned that bridge. So, I think he's going to be pulling ahead in people's estimation. But, Jeb Bush, he said illegal immigration was an act of love. Is he saying every act of immigration was an act of love with this guy who murdered that beautiful woman in San Francisco, was that an act of love of Jeb?"" She added that Rick Perry ""was the pioneer of the argument that fences don't work, buckets and wheels don't work. It's — the craziest argument I've ever heard. Have they heard of East Germany and the Soviet Union? They wanted to keep people in, we want to keep people out. Fences work just fine.""
She later argued, ""it's going to be very easy for someone like a Sen. Ted Cruz or maybe Scott Walker. ... Because this is a big opening. It's the same opening Ronald Reagan had when the Republican Party was officially for the Equal Rights Amendment, much of the Republican Party was for gun control, much of the Republican Party was for abortion. They are standing with the elites and the Wall Street crowd. You get one Republican to come along and speak straight about what the people want to hear, and the media is always surprised, 'Oh, he's doing so well.' There's a reason Trump is doing well, and I mean, at this point, we just want a Republican who can do math and figure out unless immigrants are voting 51% for Republicans, you're losing Republicans and post-1970 immigrant,s legal immigrants are voting 8-2 for the Democrats. So, this is a suicidal strategy. And I think some of the smarter Republicans will wake up and clean up in the primaries.""
Coulter concluded, ""It's interesting, a lot of these Republicans talk tough when they need our vote, like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)80%did running against amnesty, but then got to Washington and spent three years pushing amnesty the Republican Party, their base are working class white males and their wives. That's when Republicans clean up. That's when — the two landslide presidential elections Republicans have won in the last century, Nixon and Reagan, that was appealing directly to that base, and that is exactly what Donald Trump is doing. He's enormously popular with the working class. He's quite popular with black people who want those jobs.""

Bill O'Reilly said tonight that Donald Trump's immigration analysis is correct and blamed liberal policies for the death of a San Francisco woman at the hands of an illegal immigrant.
""The Factor"" host asserted the ""primary mistake"" that Trump made in his campaign kickoff speech was ""speaking too generally about the border problem.""
""Most Mexicans who sneak into the USA or overstay their legal visitation status, do so because they are economically deprived. They are largely under-educated folks who are trying to feed their families,"" O'Reilly said. ""Also, the vast majority of illegal aliens do not commit crimes while on American soil apart from their immigration offense.""
He asserted that there are ""big problems stemming from Mexican illegal immigration.""
O'Reilly said the United States' major supplier of illegal drugs is from drug cartels in Mexico.
""ISIS has nothing on these drug cartels,"" he stated. ""They are both savage enterprises.""
""So Trump is correct in saying that only a massive wall will stop the chaos and even then drugs and people will get through although not to the extent they do now,"" O'Reilly explained.
He stated that Trump is also right about how the majority of Mexicans who are coming to live in America ""are not achievers in the economic sense.""
O'Reilly further asserted that the Obama administration is ""complicit"" for the murder of San Francisco woman. Kate Steinle was shot last week by Francisco Sanchez, an illegal immigrant who was previously deported multiple times.
He explained that Sanchez returned to San Francisco, because it's a ""sanctuary city.""
""The mayor and city supervisors of San Francisco are directly responsible for the murder of Kate Steinle, and the Obama administration is complicit,"" O'Reilly said.

Donald Trump went ""On The Record"" tonight, where he reacted to ESPN and NASCAR cutting ties with him over his controversial remarks.
""It's unbelievable,"" Trump told Greta Van Susteren. ""One was a banquet and one was a golf outing ... The whole thing is crazy.""
Trump remarked that ""they'll both be back next year as soon as things blow over.""
""Why are they coming at me? Because I'm against illegal immigration,"" Trump stated. ""I speak up for the country ... I'm totally opposed to it ... Frankly, people have given me great credit for talking about it. I brought a subject to light.""
The 2016 GOP presidential candidate said businesses have bailed on him because ""they want to be politically correct.""
Van Susteren asked Trump if he will drop out of the race because of the backlash he has received.
""No, I love it. I'm bringing ... lots of different elements that are very important,"" Trump replied. ""We have incompetent leadership, we have leaders that don't know anything about negotiating, we're getting killed by China, we're getting killed by Mexico, we're getting killed by Japan.""
He added that ""we are a bunch of very very foolishly led people.""
""I want to make America great again, that's more important to me than my company,"" Trump stated. ""We will never be great if we keep going like this, we will never be great again as a country.""

TRUMP TAKES TOP SPOT IN USA TODAY/SUFFOLK UNIVERSITY POLL
July 14, 2015 (New York, N.Y.) - The latest poll from highly respected USA Today/ Suffolk University shows Donald Trump with 17% at the top of a crowded GOP field. Mr. Trump has been pulling ahead of the competition in recent weeks with his truthful talk on a number of issues, which has been resonating with voters across the country.
The USA Today/ Suffolk University poll is one of several recently released polls showing Mr. Trump as a definitive top tier choice for the 2016 Republican Presidential primary.
Also released this week, the most recent poll from Reuters, which shows Mr. Trump tied for first place alongside establishment candidate Jeb Bush and the latest results from the Monmouth University poll which shows Mr. Trump in second place with 13%. Both polls contributed to the Huffington Post pollster average showing Mr. Trump as the clear lead amongst the 2016 GOP field.
Mr. Trump will be in Laconia, New Hampshire on Thursday for a rally; he will then travel to Arkansas on Friday to meet with voters at the Republican Party of Arkansas's 2015 Reagan Rockefeller Dinner and will visit Iowa on Saturday where he will attend the Family Leadership Summit in Ames.

Donald J. Trump Files Personal Financial Disclosure Statement With Federal Election Commission
For Immediate Release:
(New York, NY) July 15, 2015 - Today, Donald J. Trump filed his Personal Financial Disclosure (PFD) forms with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).
This report was not designed for a man of Mr. Trump's massive wealth. For instance, they have boxes once a certain number is reached that simply state $50 million or more. Many of these boxes have been checked. As an example, if a building owned by Mr. Trump is worth $1.5 billion, the box checked is ""$50,000,000 or more.""
Mr. Trump stated, ""First people said I would never run, and I did. Then, they said, I would never file my statement of candidacy with the FEC, and I did. Next, they said I would never file my personal financial disclosure forms. I filed them early despite the fact that I am allowed two 45 days extensions. Now I have surged in the polls and am fighting to Make America Great Again. I look forward to the challenge of winning the presidency and doing a fantastic job for our country. I will make the United States rich and strong and respected again, but also a country with a 'big heart' toward the care of our people.""
Mr. Trump's net worth has increased since the more than one year old financial statement produced at his presidential announcement. Real estate values in New York City, San Francisco, Miami and many other places where he owns property have gone up considerably during this period of time. His debt is a very small percentage of value, and at very low interest rates. As of this date, Mr. Trump's net worth is in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.
Mr. Trump's income for the year 2014, as reported in the PFD statement, is $362 million dollars (which does not include dividends, interest, capital gains, rents and royalties).
In addition, he was successful in choosing multiple stocks which were sold in January 2014. Even though stock market purchases are not something that Mr. Trump has focused on in the past, and while only a small part of his net worth, 40 of the 45 stocks purchased went up in a relatively short period of time, creating a gain of $27,021,471, not including those stocks still remaining in the portfolio which currently have an unrealized gain of over $22 million (schedule attached).
Mr. Trump showed almost 500 business entities of which 91% are owned 100% by him. Mr. Trump wrote Trump: The Art of the Deal, one of the bestselling business books of all time, and numerous other bestsellers over the years.
NBC/Universal renewed, at the upfronts this year, The Apprentice (for a 15th season), but Mr. Trump decided to turn them down in order to run for President of the United States. NBC was not happy. During the 14 seasons of The Apprentice, Mr. Trump was paid $213,606,575.

(New York, NY) July 23, 2015 — Today, Donald J. Trump, announced the formation of the ""Veterans for Trump"" Coalition in New Hampshire. These veterans have pledged their support to Mr. Trump in the primary, and they will be advocating for him among other veterans and military families in New Hampshire, where there continues to be overwhelming support for Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump stated, ""Our Veterans are incredibly important and I'm proud to have the support of this coalition, especially in New Hampshire, where if I am elected I will build a full-service, first-class VA hospital to ensure all New Hampshire Veterans received the care they deserve. I love all Veterans and will help them finally lead the kind of lives that they should be leading.""
The Trump for President Veteran's Coalition's co-chairs are: Rep. Werner Horn of Franklin, Rep. Dan Tamburello of Londonderry, Rep. Joe Pitre of Farmington and Jerry Delemus of Rochester.
Dan Tamburello of the Marine Corps said, ""I believe that Donald Trump has the leadership, the will, the courage, and the unabashed love-of country Americans so desperately crave in the White House. We have some very serious issues facing this country that are going to take a steely-eyed, proven, tough leader to overcome. Furthermore, should Mr. Trump find his way into the White House, he won't owe anything to anyone except the American people. Mr. Trump is a Patriot who loves his country, the American people, and cares about America being respected and great again. I believe he has what it takes to restore the faith of America's allies and be respected by our enemies once more.""
In addition to forming the New Hampshire Veterans Coalition, earlier this week Mr. Trump established a hotline (855- VETS- 352) and email address ([email protected]) for Veterans to share their stories about the need to reform our Veterans Administration.
If he is elected President he will take care of these and all Veteran complaints very quickly and efficiently.

What about this Fox poll? We are in first place! All the polls confirm it! We continue to prove we are ready to take our country back and, more than any other candidate; we have the support of the people.
Yesterday I traveled to Laredo, Texas to visit the border and meet with local law enforcement officials. We discussed the need for stronger border security and the importance of continuing the national discussion on this issue. Strengthening our border will most benefit legal immigrants and working class Americans. Continuing to allow illegal immigrants to cross a weak border is hurting America's economy.
Many politicians in Washington talk about the border but have no idea how dangerous it really is. I went to the border to make sure the American people have the opportunity to see the truth.

Meeting with Laredo Mayor Pete Saenz, City Manager Jesus Olivares, and the Laredo Police Department
Earlier this week I hosted my South Carolina campaign kickoff. Hundreds of veterans came to watch my speech. I announced the launch of a new hotline, 855 — VETS — 352, and email address, [email protected], for Veterans to share their stories about the need to reform our Veterans Administration. The way veterans are being treated in our country is a disgrace and I am the candidate that will fix it.

Meeting with veterans in South Carolina
I made a campaign stop in Nevada to speak at Freedom Fest. In front of 2,000 energized conservatives I made a pledge that I will remake today; as President I will restore the American free market and ensure that companies are incentivized to bring factories and jobs back to American soil.

Speaking at Freedom Fest
I also traveled to Phoenix to host a rally.15,000 people showed up. It was an incredible testament to the deep commitment of the American people to restoring American greatness. We have stayed silent for far too longwatching bad policies wreak havoc on our economy and our nation. I will take care of our veterans, rebuild our military, and secure our borders.

Our incredible crowd in Phoenix, AZ
Most politicians would have backed down after being relentlessly targeted by the media.I will never stop speaking out on behalf of all Americans.
We have been bringing our message across America over the past several weeks. In California I met withthe families of six victims who were killed by illegal aliens. Each family shared their story. It was a heartbreaking reminder of why we must secure our border — to make sure no more Americans are senselessly killed by illegal aliens.
Our unprotected border is a threat to the stability of our economy, the personal safety of Americans, and our national security. Too many American lives have been lost because our leaders refuse to secure the border.

Standing with the families of victims
I also filed myFEC financial disclosure form. I have spent my life building businesses in large American cities and small American towns. I will use my experience to put Americans back to work — and the polls prove that the people know I am the only one who can do it.

Some of our enthusiastic supporters
This campaign is about changing Washington. We need to once again have a government that is of the people, for the people and by the people.
We will make America Great Again!

Picture a bar graph that averages the best political polls. Donald Trump stands above the crowded skyline of Republican candidates like one of his boastful buildings. First in the nation, first in Iowa, first in New Hampshire, and first, for the last 11 weeks. Political architects are amazed because Trump rose on a shaky foundation, his ""shoot from the lip"" style managed to offend women, Latinos, and American POWs. Now, with summer over, and four months to Iowa, voters captivated by a larger than life personality begin to want the fine details. That's what we were looking for, this past Tuesday, when we met Trump, on top, in his Fifth Avenue penthouse in Manhattan. He surprised us with news about his tax plan.

(New York, NY) October 23rd, 2015 - Donald J. Trump today announced he sent notices Wednesday disavowing nine unauthorized Super PAC's claiming to support him in his bid for the Republican nomination for President of the United States and subsequently demanding the return of all funds raised. Mr. Trump is self-funding his campaign and is only accepting unsolicited small dollar donations, of which he has received more than 75,000 with an average amount of $50 since launching his campaign. He has repeatedly stated his opposition to the use of Super PAC's and major contributions, which he has consistently turned down since announcing his candidacy and is calling on all candidates to do the same.
Mr. Trump stated, ""I am self-funding my campaign and therefore I will not be controlled by the donors, special interests and lobbyists who have corrupted our politics and politicians for far too long. I have disavowed all Super PAC's, requested the return of all donations made to said PAC's, and I am calling on all Presidential candidates to do the same. The character of our country is only as strong as our leaders---the only special interest I am beholden to is the American people and together we will Make America Great Again!""
The letters, produced by Mr. Trump's campaign counsel, were sent on Wednesday, October 21st, 2015 and disavow all fundraising activities based on the confusion said PAC's could potentially cause with supporters across the country. Additionally, the letters request the return of any donations made to date. The letters state, ""We are providing this written notice that your organization is not authorized to use Mr. Trump's name and likeness in connection with its fundraising activities, and we are formally disavowing such activities. Thus, given the invocation of Donald J. Trump in connection with your activities, we ask that you refund all funds received by you in connection with any fundraising undertaken to specifically support and/or done in the name of Donald J. Trump...The campaign has never received money from your PAC, nor does the campaign want any money, services or goods from your committee.""
While Mr. Trump appreciates the incredible outpouring of grassroots support from all over the country he will continue to campaign with integrity, wholly independent of the dark money, donor class perpetuating a broken Washington, D.C. and the all talk, no action politicians propped up by donations representing corporate interests. Mr. Trump's only interest is to represent the people of the United States and Make America Great Again.

Trump Addresses Highly Detrimental Currency Manipulation
(New York, NY) November 10th, 2015- Donald J. Trump today unveiled his most recent policy on trade reforms, highlighting his position in a Wall Street Journal op-ed entitled Ending China's Currency Manipulation. Mr. Trump has consistently been a strong critic of these tactics that prohibit fair trade and have been largely neglected by the all talk, no action politicians that have failed us for far too long. Mr. Trumpoutlines common sense solutions to address the major threat of currency manipulation and trade reforms that will Make America Great Again.
How We Got Here: Washington Politicians Let China Off The Hook
In January 2000, President Bill Clinton boldly promised China's inclusion in the World Trade Organization (WTO) ""is a good deal for America. Our products will gain better access to China's market, and every sector from agriculture, to telecommunications, to automobiles. But China gains no new market access to the United States."" None of what President Clinton promised came true. Since China joined the WTO, Americans have witnessed the closure of more than 50,000 factories and the loss of tens of millions of jobs. It was not a good deal for America then and it's a bad deal now. It is a typical example of how politicians in Washington have failed our country.
The most important component of our China policy is leadership and strength at the negotiating table. We have been too afraid to protect and advance American interests and to challenge China to live up to its obligations. We need smart negotiators who will serve the interests of American workers - not Wall Street insiders that want to move U.S. manufacturing and investment offshore.
The Goal Of The Trump Plan: Fighting For American Businesses And Workers
America has always been a trading nation. Under the Trump administration trade will flourish. However, for free trade to bring prosperity to America, it must also be fair trade. Our goal is not protectionism but accountability. America fully opened its markets to China but China has not reciprocated. Its Great Wall of Protectionism uses unlawful tariff and non-tariff barriers to keep American companies out of China and to tilt the playing field in their favor.
If you give American workers a level playing field, they will win. At its heart, this plan is a negotiating strategy to bring fairness to our trade with China. The results will be huge for American businesses and workers. Jobs and factories will stop moving offshore and instead stay here at home. The economy will boom. The steps outlined in this plan will make that a reality.
When Donald J. Trump is president, China will be on notice that America is back in the global leadership business and that their days of currency manipulation and cheating are over. We will cut a better deal with China that helps American businesses and workers compete.
The Trump Plan Will Achieve The Following Goals:
1. Bring China to the bargaining table by immediately declaring it a currency manipulator.
2. Protect American ingenuity and investment by forcing China to uphold intellectual property laws and stop their unfair and unlawful practice of forcing U.S. companies to share proprietary technology with Chinese competitors as a condition of entry to China's market.
3. Reclaim millions of American jobs and reviving American manufacturing by putting an end to China's illegal export subsidies and lax labor and environmental standards. No more sweatshops or pollution havens stealing jobs from American workers.
4. Strengthen our negotiating position by lowering our corporate tax rate to keep American companies and jobs here at home, attacking our debt and deficit so China cannot use financial blackmail against us, and bolstering the U.S. military presence in the East and South China Seas to discourage Chinese adventurism.

(New York, NY) November 18th, 2015 - Today Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. began airing new radio advertisements in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. The ads are part of a $300,000 buy announced earlier this month and feature Mr. Trump, Campaign Co-Chair and Iowa Republican Sam Clovis, New Hampshire resident and Trump for President supporter, Louise Buck.
With recent events putting an added emphasis on illegal immigration, homeland security, strengthening our military, and defeating ISIS, which have been cornerstones of Mr. Trump's campaign since its inception, the ads highlight his vision, leadership and competency.
Mr. Trump stated, ""We must address Islamic terrorism and protect our country first. I will lead by example, as I always have, by vowing to defeat ISIS, stop illegal immigration and the Syrian refugee program, secure our border and bring real change to Washington, D.C. I am the only one who can Make America Great Again.""
The ads stress the need for real change in Washington, D.C. in order to address problems created by the ""all talk, no action politicians"" that have failed American's for far too long. Mr. Trump reminds voters he is self-funding his campaign, unlike all the other republican candidates who are funded by scam Super PAC's, lobbyists, and special interests. His financial independence and proven leadership as a job creator and businessman with a hugely successful career built on real results serve as yet another major distinction.
Sam Clovis is an Iowa based conservative serving as national Co-Chair for the campaign. He describes Mr. Trump's candidacy as historical and reinforces Mr. Trump's unparalleled success and proven capability to get things done. Louise Buck is a New Hampshire resident who voices her concerns about homeland security and her support for Mr. Trump as the only choice for a Commander in Chief that will protect American families first.

(New York, NY) November 18th, 2015 - The Donald J. Trump for President Campaign has announced its Southwest Virginia Leadership Team comprised of current and former local elected officials and party leaders.
Mr. Trump stated, ""It is an honor to be on ballot in the state of Virginia where we have a great staff and team of volunteers in place. I am pleased to announce the Southwest Virginia Leadership Team as we continue to be successful in Virginia and across the country.""
Jack Morgan, the former Chairman of the Ninth Congressional District Republican Party will serve as Chairman of the Ninth District Team. Former Buchanan County Commonwealth's Attorney Tamara Neo will serve as Mr. Morgan's Co-Chair.
""It is an honor to support Mr. Trump, who is a proven leader with unparalleled capabilities and successes. He is undoubtedly the strongest candidate and he continues to generate unprecedented enthusiasm across the state of Virginia and around the country. I look forward to working with the staff and volunteers here in Virginia as we share Mr. Trump's vision to Make America Great Again.""
Other members of the leadership team include former Allegheny/Covington Republican Party Chairman, Derrick Barr, Tazewell County Supervisor, Seth White, Christiansburg Town Councilman, Harry Collins, Richlands Mayor, Jan White, Richlands Vice Mayor, Doug Ratliff and the former Sheriff of Patrick County, Jay Gregory.
Virginians in Southwest Virginia have born the brunt of the failed and misguided government policies for years. Overreaching regulations and the Obama Administration's outright war on coal has uprooted and destroyed families and entire communities that have lived in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia for generations.
Horrible trade deals such as NAFTA, which Mr. Trump has consistently opposed, have shipped manufacturing jobs overseas, and crippled the area economically. America, now more than ever, needs a true leader with proven ideas and real world experience to fix Washington. Mr. Trump is the only one who can Make America Great Again.
Mr. Trump has visited Virginia several times since launching his campaign in June and was recently the first Republican candidate to qualify for ballot access after submitting 16,000 signatures. Last month, Mr. Trump hosted a capacity crowd at a rally in Richmond and weeks later unveiled his Veterans Affairs Reform Plan in Norfolk, Virginia with thousands in attendance at the USS Wisconsin. Mr. Trump owns the award winning Trump Winery in Charlottesville, Virginia where he employs hundreds of people and visits often. He will return to Virginia early next month.

Donald Trump leads the race for the Republican nomination in New Hampshire, while Bernie Sanders edges Hillary Clinton among Democrats.
That's according to the latest Fox News poll, released Wednesday, and conducted since Friday's terrorist attacks in Paris.
Trump leads with 27 percent of New Hampshire Republican primary voters. Marco Rubio receives the support of 13 percent, just above Ted Cruz at 11 percent. That's it for the double-digit candidates.
CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS
Jeb Bush and Ben Carson garner 9 percent each, followed by John Kasich at 7 percent and Chris Christie at 6 percent.
Just three percent back Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul, while Lindsey Graham, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum get one percent each.
There are differences in how some candidates are doing in New Hampshire versus their recent national standing (pre-Paris). For example, Carson is Trump's closest competitor nationally, yet he doesn't break double digits here. And the reverse is true for Bush, Christie and Kasich, who do better in New Hampshire than nationally.
The poll, however, also shows that the race is in flux: 55 percent of GOP primary voters say they could change their mind before February's balloting. Less than half, 44 percent, feel certain of their choice.
When asked about their second choice candidate, GOP primary voters put Carson at the top of the list at 16 percent. Rubio is close behind at 13 percent and Trump at 11 percent.
When first and second-choice preferences are combined, Trump (38 percent) and Rubio (26 percent) are still at the top. However, Carson (25 percent) moves above Cruz (20 percent) and Bush (16 percent).
The favorites among those NH GOP primary voters who identify as ""very"" conservative are Cruz (27 percent), Trump (26 percent), Carson (13 percent) and Rubio (13 percent).
Here's how the race for the Democratic nomination stands: Sanders has a razor-thin one-point edge over Clinton -- 45-44 percent. Martin O'Malley gets 5 percent.
Sanders can thank younger voters for his edge. Those under age 45 back him by 29 points (59-30 percent). Those ages 45 and over are more likely to support Clinton by 17 points (52-35 percent).
Men go for Sanders over Clinton by 49-37 percent. Among women, the vote divides 48 percent for Clinton vs. 42 percent for Sanders.
Potential General Election Matchups
All the candidates remain below 50 percent in the hypothetical matchups tested in this battleground state.
Although Trump is the top choice of Republican primary voters, he performs the worst against Clinton in general election ballot tests. Clinton bests Trump by seven points (47-40 percent), Cruz by three points (44-41 percent) and Christie by one (44-43 percent).
Clinton and Fiorina tie at 43 percent each.
Four Republican candidates come out ahead of the presumptive Democratic nominee: Rubio is ahead by 7 points (47-40 percent), Bush (45-42 percent) and Kasich (43-40 percent) are up by 3 points each, and Carson has a 2-point edge (45-43 percent).
President Barack Obama won New Hampshire in both the 2012 presidential election (by 52-46 percent over Republican Mitt Romney) and in 2008 (by 54-45 percent over Republican John McCain).
Among New Hampshire voters overall, about 6 in 10 are unhappy with the way things are going in the country today (58 percent), including 31 percent who are ""not at all"" satisfied.
Nearly 9 of 10 Republicans are dissatisfied with how things are going (86 percent), compared to 60 percent of independents and 29 percent of Democrats.
That dissatisfaction is reflected in Obama's performance rating, as more New Hampshire voters disapprove (50 percent) than approve (43 percent) of the job he is doing.
The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R). The poll was conducted November 15-17, 2015, by telephone (landline and cellphone) with live interviewers among a sample of 804 New Hampshire registered voters selected from a statewide voter file. Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, and 5.5 points for Democratic primary voters and 5 points for Republican primary voters. The hypothetical matchups were split sampled, which means each question was only asked of half the sample and the results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 points.

Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson — better known as Diamond and Silk — wowed a capacity crowd for Donald Trump in Boloxi, Mississippi Saturday night. Promoting themes of unity and togetherness, Hardaway riled up the crowd that WKRG reported was 14,000.
""In this room is unity,"" Hardaway said. ""In this room we are united. This is the United States, not the divided states,"" she said.
""It's time for us all to take America back because this is our country. It's imperative you get out and vote. If you don't want to get left, you've got to get right,"" Hardaway said to cheers.
""We want somebody to build a wall, don't we? We want somebody to bring back our jobs so we can thrive again, don't we? We want somebody that's going to keep us safe, don't we?""
Her biggest applause line? ""There is only one race: the human race, as all of our lives matter in this room.""
She added, ""We finally have a candidate that realizes that and that's why it's imperative you vote for Donald J. Trump!""
The duo also joined Trump on stage at his Raleigh, North Carolina rally in early December.
""How great are they!"" Trump exclaimed while the duo — known as Diamond and Silk — walked onto the stage.
""I turn on my television one night,"" a hoarse Trump said, ""and I see these two on television. I say 'they are the greatest.' They became an internet sensation.""

""First of all, I'm glad that the media can see us,"" she said. ""I want everybody to know that we stand behind Donald J. Trump!
""We support Donald J. Trump! We endorse Donald J. Trump,"" the pair said simultaneously to wild applause.

The man asked that Trump send his wife a bouquet of flowers. Trump agreed.
True to his word, the bouquet arrived several weeks later along with a note saying, ""we've paid off your mortgage.""
The story, which has been recounted numerous times including in Forbes Magazine, is just one of many that demonstrate the generosity of Donald Trump according to Jerry Falwell Jr., son of the late pastor Jerry Falwell and President of Liberty University.
""I got to know Donald Trump after he spoke [at Liberty University] in 2012,"" Falwell told Sean on Hannity. ""I learned so much about him that the public never hears."" Falwell went on to list Trump's numerous charitable givings.
""Right after he visited here last time I called him about a large Christian ministry in another state that needed some help,"" Falwell explained. ""I learned within a day or two he had donated 100,000 dollars of his own money.""
Falwell also recounted the story of an inner inner city basketball tournament Trump rescued from financial disaster.
""He learned about Clyde Frazier Jr. who ran the Harlem Hoops tournament in the inner city and was killed in the 9/11 attacks,"" Falwell said. ""He searched down the family and donated the money to keep that tournament going.""

He continues to dominate all Arizona state polls and lead by wide, double digit margins in all national polls.
Treasurer DeWit added, ""Our country's political elite have forgotten that this country was built with grit and hard work, and don't seem to understand the economic ramifications of the laws they pass. As a businessman, turned State Treasurer, I am a big believer that we cannot rely on politicians to put our country back on the path to prosperity. We need a conservative political outsider with financial savvy and success, who understands what it means to build a business, make payroll, and flourish during tough times. America is fortunate to have this and more in Mr. Donald J. Trump.""
DeWit continued, ""As someone who has spent one on one time with him, I can tell you that Mr. Trump is one of the smartest and quickest minds of our time. His business success is extraordinary. His passion for America, our veterans, and protecting our freedoms is inspiring. But what may be his most admirable quality is his willingness to give back and serve our country, and fight to see that our children and our grandchildren will have the same opportunities to live, work, and raise a family in the greatest country ever known to man, the USA. I have been proud to stand with Mr. Trump since before his campaign for President was announced and in every step along the way, and I am excited to now serve as his campaign Chairman in Arizona to ensure victory in 2016.

Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate, is officially endorsing businessman Donald Trump's 2016 bid for the White House.
""We are ready for a change,"" Palin said at a Trump rally in Ames, Iowa, with the candidate by her side. ""We are ready, and our troops deserve the best -- a new commander in chief whose track record has proven he is a master at the art of the deal.""
She added, ""He is beholden to no one but we the people -- how refreshing.""
Trump said in a statement that Palin ""is a friend, and a high quality person whom I have great respect for. I am proud to have her support.""
Palin is one of the most high-profile Republicans yet to endorse a 2016 candidate, giving the current GOP front runner more momentum in the final two weeks before the Iowa caucuses. After joining Trump in Ames, Iowa on Tuesday, she will travel with him to his two campaign events on Wednesday, in Norwalk, Iowa and Tulsa, Oklahoma.
In a press release, Trump's campaign touted the endorsement as ""coveted and influential."" The campaign called her ""a trusted conservative"" and credited her with helping to launch the career of several ""key future leaders of the Republican Party"" -- including Trump's biggest rival for the GOP nomination, Sen. Ted Cruz. The press release quotes Cruz, who said, ""I would not be in the United States Senate were it not for Gov. Sarah Palin... She can pick winners.""
Earlier, Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler told CNN that if Palin endorses Trump, it would be a ""blow"" to her reputation because, he said, Trump has held progressive views throughout his life.
That prompted Palin's daughter Bristol Palin to slam the Texas senator in a blog post titled ""Is THIS Why People Don't Like Cruz?""
On the campaign trail in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Cruz tried to diffuse the situation. ""Oh listen, I love Sarah Palin, Sarah Palin is fantastic,"" he said. ""Without her friendship and support, I wouldn't be in the Senate today, and so regardless of what Sarah decides to do in 2016, I will always remain a big, big fan of Sarah Palin's.""

Had I not brought up the subject of illegal immigration, an issue which Ted Cruz is very weak on, nobody would even be talking about it. I will build a great wall, and Mexico will pay for it.""
The footage captures Senator Cruz in a confused state, unable to answer simple policy questions, as he contemplates his position, advice from his pollsters, donors and the special interests who control him. The only special interest Mr. Trump is beholden to is the American people, and he is the only candidate that will stop illegal immigration and Make America Great Again.
The ad will run on TV in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Mr. Trump continues to spend $2 million dollars per week on advertising. Mr. Trump continues to dominate all local and national polls, including in Iowa, where we are less than two weeks away from the Caucuses and the most recent poll from CNN shows Mr. Trump with an 11 point lead.
Mr. Trump was in Iowa earlier this week where he received the coveted endorsement of influential conservative Sarah Palin, who previously endorsed Ted Cruz during his Senatorial bid, and attributed his success to her support stating, ""She picks winners."" Mr. Trump will return to Iowa over the weekend and several days next week ahead of the Iowa Caucus on February 1st.

Trump debuted the campaign's most recent radio ad to begin airing in Iowa and South Carolina featuring Jerry Falwell Jr. Mr. Trump was a guest at Liberty University on Monday and was introduced by Falwell who spoke glowingly of Mr. Trump's success, leadership and character, which he stated reminded him of his late father.
Mr. Trump said, ""It was a great honor to be introduced by the legendary Jerry Falwell Jr. He has built a tremendous institution and is a really terrific person with a beautiful family. We have always had a wonderful relationship and I am proud to share his kind words with the people of Iowa and South Carolina.""
The ad features statements from Falwell's introduction of Mr. Trump at the Liberty University convocation this week, which was attended by a record crowd of students and supporters. Falwell is a highly respected and influential figure in Evangelical communities.
In the ad Mr. Falwell says, ""I see a lot of parallels between my father and Donald Trump. Like Mr. Trump, Dad would speak his mind. He would make statements that were politically incorrect. He speaks the truth publicly, even if it is uncomfortable for people to hear it. Dad explained that when he walked into the voting booth, he wasn't electing a Sunday school teacher, or a pastor, or even a President who shared his theological beliefs. He was electing a President of the United States to lead a nation.""
Mr. Trump continues to lead all national and state polls with the latest polls from Iowa and New Hampshire showing him with substantial, double digit leads over his nearest rival. The CNN/ORC poll from Iowa shows Mr. Trump with 36% support and an 11 point lead over Senator Ted Cruz and a 20 point lead over Cruz in the WMUR/CNN poll out of New Hampshire. Mr. Trump will return to Iowa this weekend and campaign in all three primary states throughout the week.

FOX News is making tens of millions of dollars on debates, and setting ratings records (the highest in history), where as in previous years they were low-rated afterthoughts.
Unlike the very stupid, highly incompetent people running our country into the ground, Mr. Trump knows when to walk away. Roger Ailes and FOX News think they can toy with him, but Mr. Trump doesn't play games. There have already been six debates, and according to all online debate polls including Drudge, Slate, Time Magazine, and many others, Mr. Trump has won all of them, in particular the last one. Whereas he has always been a job creator and not a debater, he nevertheless truly enjoys the debating process - and it has been very good for him, both in polls and popularity.
He will not be participating in the FOX News debate and will instead host an event in Iowa to raise money for the Veterans and Wounded Warriors, who have been treated so horribly by our all talk, no action politicians. Like running for office as an extremely successful person, this takes guts and it is the kind of mentality our country needs in order to Make America Great Again.

Iowans are pretty serious about hunting and so too are some of the Trumps. The sons of the Republican presidential frontrunner, Donald Trump, Jr. and his younger brother, Eric, are in Iowa for the the caucus, but they managed to squeeze in some pheasant hunting while they were here, and they invited me and a few other reporters to join them.
They acknowledge they were looking for a photo op to prove that despite being fancy New Yorkers, they share a pastime beloved by many Iowans. But as I learned today, they're also pretty good shots.
Their father does not hunt, but both brothers have been hunting since they were kids, introduced to the sport by their maternal grandfather, who encouraged them to embrace the great outdoors during summers spent with him in what was then Czechoslovakia, a life altogether different than the one they lived on Fifth Avenue.
And both brothers credit a love of the outdoor for keeping them grounded during that childhood of privilege. They say they know some Americans don't understand the appeal of the sport and especially their fondness for big-game hunting in Africa, which has drawn the ire of online critics. But they are ardent defenders of what they see as the legacy of Teddy Roosevelt: hunting as a pastime complementary to conservation.

Former Massachusetts senator Scott P. Brown, a moderate Republican who two years ago ran for Senate in New Hampshire, will endorse Donald Trump at a rally here Tuesday night, one week before the state's presidential primary.
Brown's decision has been closely guarded for days, but it was confirmed by two people familiar with the event, where Brown will appear onstage with the candidate.
When reached early Tuesday afternoon, the Trump campaign's spokesperson would not discuss the rally or possible guests. Brown was unavailable for comment.
Brown's move could give Trump a significant boost one day after the mogul lost the Iowa caucuses to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.
Although Brown was defeated in his senatorial bid here, he has been a popular GOP figure in New England ever since his stunning, come-from-behind victory in Massachusetts's special election to fill the Senate seat in 2010.
Brown is also a favorite of many establishment Republicans because of his centrist positions, including support for abortion rights and for a ban on assault weapons. His profile and personality, however, are blue collar and populist. He drove a pickup truck during his Senate bids and is a habituй of Cheap Trick concerts.
On the endorsement front, Brown is the first U.S. senator, current or former, to formally back Trump.
In the New Hampshire contest, Trump faces stiff competition not only from Cruz but from a crowd of mainstream Republicans who have strong pockets of support in and have been relentlessly campaigning in the state, such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Florida governor Jeb Bush. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who placed a strong third in Iowa, is another threat.
The relationship between Trump and Brown has grown cozy in recent months with a series of meetings and phone calls. At a January event in Portsmouth, N.H., Trump said Brown was cut out of ""central casting"" and could be his vice-presidential pick. Brown called Trump ""the next president of the United States.""
Speaking with reporters after the event, Brown said he was weighing three factors as he decided whom to endorse: ""Somebody who is not afraid to make a decision and doesn't always follow the polls; sometimes who will be politically incorrect and will do what's best for this country. ... Someone also who is not afraid to admit when they're wrong.""
That somebody is Trump.

He is a man of accomplishment and speaks the truth in words everyone can understand, instills confidence in the people about our country's bright future, and reflects and believes in the strength and determination necessary for success. These qualities - and his quiet compassion for those in need - are essential to making America Great Again. Now is the time for Donald Trump.""
Mr. Trump will be in Florence this evening for a rally with a record crowd expected to attend. The Trump Campaign continues to dominate in South Carolina with all recent polls showing Mr. Trump with substantial, double digit leads in all state polls and great momentum as the February 20th primary contest approaches.

Mr. Trump says, ""People wouldn't be talking about illegal immigration had I not brought it up when I announced I was running for President. It is a massive problem in our country and now everybody agrees with me --- bad for crime and the economy. A wonderful young man, Jamiel Shaw Jr., whose father has become a friend of mine, was shot in the face for no reason by an illegal immigrant. He was getting ready to go to college on a football scholarship and his sole fault was walking home to see his father. Because of the relationship I have established with his father, Jamiel's death is very personal to me. We must stop illegal immigration.""
Jamiel Shaw added, ""Donald Trump is the only person fighting to put American families first. He will protect our children and put an end to these senseless acts of violence that are caused by our failed policies and broken immigration system. Donald Trump has made it clear he, like most Americans, wants to return the rule of law to the people of this country. Without strong borders we don't have a country. Strong border enforcement is the first step to preventing future tragedies. We must secure our borders and return those who came here illegally to their native lands.

OPED - The Culture of Life",http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=113891,Donald Trump,"Let me be clear—I am pro-life. I support that position with exceptions allowed for rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk. I did not always hold this position, but I had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me. My story is well documented, so I will not retell it here. However, what I will do with the remaining space is express my feelings about life, and the culture of life, as we approach the 43nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade.
I build things. There is a process involved in building things. We tap into a lot of disciplines with engineering being one of the most important. The rules for putting structures together are as strict as are the rules of physics. These rules have stood the test of time and have become the path to putting together structures that endure and are beautiful. America, when it is at its best, follows a set of rules that have worked since our founding. One of those rules is that we, as Americans, revere life and have done so since our Founders made it the first, and most important, of our ""unalienable"" rights.
Over time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country. They never had the chance to become doctors, musicians, farmers, teachers, husbands, fathers, sons or daughters. They never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills, lives, loves or passions into the fabric of country. They are missing, and they are missed.
The Supreme Court in 1973 based their decision on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found. Even if we take the court at its word, that abortion is a matter of privacy, we should then extend the argument to the logical conclusion that private funds, then, should subsidize this choice rather than the half billion dollars given to abortion providers every year by Congress. Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best.
If using taxpayer money to facilitate our slide to a culture of death was not enough, the 1973 decision became a landmark decision demonstrating the utter contempt the court had for federalism and the 10th Amendment. Roe v. Wade gave the court an excuse to dismantle the decisions of state legislatures and the votes of the people. This is a pattern that the court has repeated over and over again since that decision. Perhaps Roe v. Wade became yet another incidence of disconnect between the people and their government.
We are in the middle of a presidential political cycle and votes will be cast in just days. The citizens of this nation will have the chance to vote for candidates that are aligned with their individual worldviews. It is my hope that they will choose the builder, the man who has the ability to imagine the greatness of this nation. The next President must follow those principles that work best and that reinforce the reverence Americans hold for life. A culture of life is too important to let slip away for convenience or political correctness. It is by preserving our culture of life that we will Make America Great Again.

Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump said Friday that Pope Francis did not understand the gravity of the ""crime problem"" caused by illegal immigrants crossing the US-Mexican border when the pontiff appeared to criticize Trump's plan for a border wall.
Trump, in an interview with Fox News' Greta Van Susteren, also maintained his stated opposition to the war in Iraq, which he has used in recent days to hammer presidential primary opponent Jeb Bush.
""He's a terrific person,"" Trump said of the pope, the leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics. ""To me it's [about] illegal immigration. I don't think the pope really understood in terms of the crime problem and the problems of illegal immigration.""
""A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,"" Pope Francis said Thursday. A Vatican spokesman clarified the Pope's remarks Friday, saying he ""in no way [made] a personal attack"" on the New York businessman.
""Without borders we don't have a country, and that [Mexican] border is just like a piece of Swiss cheese; people pour over,"" Trump told Van Susteren on ""On the Record.""
Trump also discussed a 2002 clip from the Howard Stern radio program in which he appeared to endorse the United States' invasion of Iraq. He asserted he was only a supporter of action against Iraq ""long before the war started.""
""By the time the war started, I had gone—I was absolutely opposed to it. I always thought it was a destabilization of the Middle East,"" Trump said.
""It was the worst decision ever made in the history of our country,"" Trump said. ""[The war cost] $2 trillion and thousands of lives.""
""Had [Iraqi dictator] Saddam Hussein lived—he was a bad guy, but he killed terrorists,"" Trump said, adding that if former President George W. Bush ""went to the beach and gone swimming [instead of engaging with Iraq], we'd be better off.""

Melania Trump, a rare presence on the campaign trail, offered a few words to her husband's supporters on Saturday night after the Republican presidential candidate clinched a victory in South Carolina.
""I just wanted to say, an amazing place South Carolina,"" the former model told the group of supporters, taking the microphone on stage for the first time on an election night with thousands of viewers watching on their televisions at home.
Trump said on CNN's State of the Union Sunday that the remarks were made on a whim.
""I really just surprised her when I said that,"" Trump said. ""I said say a few words, Melania, there's only about 40 million people watching. Say a few words. And she got up and she spoke beautifully.""
He described her as a brilliant woman, but noted she does not seek out publicity.
""She also is a very private woman and there's something very nice about that,"" Trump told Jake Tapper on CNN's ""State of the Union."" She's a great mother and she has some interesting causes that are going to be fantastic for the country.""
He said that while she is going to be involved int he campaign, ""what she really loves doing is being a mother to Barron.""
Melania Trump, 45, has been largely absent from the campaign trail, telling reporters that she wants to ensure the couple's 9-year-old son Baron has a steady parental presence at home.
Instead, the candidate's older children Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric, have taken on larger roles as surrogates on the campaign trail -- touting their father's candidacy on the stump and in TV news interviews.
But on Saturday night, Melania emerged to supporters' cheers.
""Congratulations to my husband, he was working very hard. And he loves you, we love you and we are going ahead to Nevada and we'll see what happens,"" she said, before giving the microphone back to her husband.
Melania Trump has addressed crowds attending her husband's political rallies in the past, usually taking the stage to offer just a few words of thanks in her Slovenian-accented English.
In rare interviews alongside her husband with People Magazine and ABC's Barbara Walters, Melania Trump has offered a few glimpses into her relationship with her now-presidential candidate husband.
""He is who he is,"" the wife of the brash billionaire told People Magazine in September for her first mainstream media interview since Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign earlier this year. ""Even if you give him advice, he will maybe take it in, but then he will do it the way he wants to do it. You cannot change a person. Let them be. Let them be the way they are.""
And she told Walters that she sometimes shares her opinions with her husband, with the billionaire candidate adding that his wife had once told him to ""tone it down a bit"" during his debate performances.

What makes Mr. Trump my choice for president is he will break the grip of the donor class on our government and make it accountable to working families again. I'm honored to help Mr. Trump Make America Great Again.""

""We owe $19 trillion -- most people don't even know what a trillion dollars is, how many hundreds of millions is in a trillion,"" Trump said. ""It's such a number that, it's a name that 10 years ago you never even heard the word trillion, but we owe $19 trillion.""
Click play to watch Trump answer Dr. Robertson about what he'd do with the power of Executive Order.
""A very bad budget was passed just about four weeks ago that's going to add at least $2 trillion to it. So we'll be up essentially to $21 trillion, and at a certain point it's really the point of no return. And you really have to have somebody that knows what he or she is doing,"" he said.
Robertson wanted to know if President Trump would have a litmus test for those he'd nominate to the Supreme Court.
""In your selection as president, what criteria would you use to pick somebody?"" he asked.
""Pro-life. We want-- It starts with that, starts with it. A very conservative, a very, very smart, I mean like Judge (Antonin) Scalia would be a perfect He was a perfect representative,"" he said.
Watch Trump's response below.
""I've always said that Justice (Clarence) Thomas doesn't get enough credit. He is a wonderful man, a wonderful guy (applause) and I've always said Judge (Samuel) Alito is a terrific guy. So, in that realm is what we're talking about for me,"" Trump explained.
Trump also addressed the President Obama's signature healthcare law.
""We're going to get rid of Obamacare,"" Trump said. ""Obamacare has turned out to be a total disaster.""
He also fielded questions about the Iranian nuclear deal in the country's involvement in Iraq.
""I didn't want to go into Iraq; it was one of the worst decisions ever made,"" Trump said. ""We lost $2 trillion, thousands and thousands of lives -- thousands of lives. We have wounded warriors who I love all over the place, and what happens? Iran is now taking over Iraq.""
""When you think of how Iran is doing lately, right? Between the Iran deal, we give them $150 billion -- we got nothing for it,"" he said. ""We should have gotten our prisoners back long before we started negotiating...(Secretary John) Kerry - this is the worst negotiator I think I've ever seen.""
In addition, Trump did not mince words when talking about his political rival and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
""Boy, did you ever see anybody so nice to the president, though? 'Oh, the president is wonderful,' she says. 'Oh, the president, he's great... You know why she's doing that, right? You know why? I know why. Boy, oh boy, she's become like a marshmallow.""
Trump also addressed President Obama's liberties with executive orders, accusing the president of resorting to them because he's not been effective in dealing with Congress.
""You're supposed to get the congressmen in, the senators in; you're supposed to make deals,"" he told Robertson. ""I deal in politics in other countries cause we're building all over the world. And we have jobs going up all over the world -- a lot of jobs. But I have never seen division like you have now.""
""The country is so divided, whether it's African American, white, congressman, Democrat, Republican. I mean it's just like we have a whole divided country. I've never seen anything like it,"" he said. ""But we used to see, and I used to be part of Democrats and Republicans having dinners together with their families and their wives, and it was a nice thing. There'd be combat the next day, but there would be -- they'd get along -- and they'd get things done.""
""So today we have a president that can't get anything done, and he signs executive orders,"" he said.
He said he's first reverse Obama's orders on the Second Amendment and his orders involving immigration.
With 49 delegates at stake, Virginia is an important state for candidates to secure enough delegates to win the Republican presidential nomination.
Trump and others know that making an appearance with CBN Founder and CEO Pat Robertson at Regent University will help their efforts to win the votes of evangelicals, which will be one key to securing victory in the state on March 1.

Trump was endorsed by former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer. Arizona is one of the states most affected by illegal immigration and Mr. Trump has received tremendous support from key officials including Sheriff Joe Arpaio, State Treasurer Jeff DeWit and is now proud to receive the support of the highly respected former Governor.
Mr. Trump says, ""I love the state of Arizona and have received incredible support throughout the state. I am leading in all the polls and we have had amazing events with tremendous crowds. I am honored to receive this endorsement from Governor Brewer.""
Jan Brewer added, ""Arizona's unsecured border is the gateway of illegal immigration into the United States and the politicians in Washington D.C. have continually failed to secure our border. As I've always said: A nation without borders is like a house without walls — it collapses. As Arizona's Governor, I witnessed too much heartache, loss and suffering caused by illegal immigration. I've seen communities destroyed by the drugs, gangs, drop houses and cartels. The cost of health care, education and incarceration for illegal immigrants places a crushing burden on taxpayers. Workers of all backgrounds are deprived of jobs and income from our open, bleeding border.""
""For years I pleaded with the federal government to do their job and secure our border. Today, we can elect a President who will do just that - Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump will secure our borders, defend our workers and protect our sovereignty. Mr. Trump will stand for our law enforcement, our police and our immigration officers.

(New York, NY) February 28th, 2016 — Today Donald J. Trump received the endorsement of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions. Senator Sessions is widely recognized as the nation's most highly respected official on the issue of illegal immigration.
Mr. Trump stated, ""I am deeply honored to have the endorsement of Senator Jeff Sessions, leader of congressional conservatives. He has been called the Senate's indispensable man and the gold standard. He led the fight against the Gang of Eight, against Obama's trade deal, against Obama's judges, and for American sovereignty. He has stood up to special interests as few have. There is no more respected man in Congress and we are closely aligned on many issues, including trade and illegal immigration, and I am proud to consider Jeff Sessions an advisor, friend and ally.""
Mr. Trump and Senator Sessions surprised the massive crowd at the frontrunner's Alabama rally just days before Super Tuesday Primary contest.
Senator Sessions added, ""I am thrilled today to offer my endorsement of Donald J. Trump for President. This election is our last chance to save U.S. sovereignty and to end the domination of the political establishment over the interests of working Americans. Trump alone has rejected the donor class, defending America's jobs and wages from open borders, uncontrolled immigration and the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership that will cede U.S. authority to foreign powers. Trump's trade and immigration plans will revitalize our shrinking middle class, keeping jobs and wealth and income inside the United States of America. Trump understands that a nation must always place the interests of its own people first.""
Senator Sessions continued, ""We are nearing fast the point of no return. The people are hurting. Their wages are declining. Their schools are overburdened. Their hospitals are stretched past the breaking point. Crime is up, and community confidence is down. Americans of all backgrounds and ethnicities, immigrant and US-born, are crying out for leadership that puts their needs first, that takes care of those living and dreaming here today, leadership that understands that there is no constituency other than the American constituency. Mr. Trump is that leader.
We are witnessing an incredible movement, arising from the people.
The events of history have aligned to give the people this fleeting chance to bust up the oligarchy — to take back control from the ‘Masters of the Universe' return it to the good and decent and patriotic citizens of the United States.""

First and foremost, under a Trump administration, the request for additional security by an ambassador would have been heeded, and second, there is no question, when the attack came,he would have moved heaven and earth to provide the necessary forces to protect and reinforce our warriors. Mr. Trump is the bold, decisive leader America needs at this time"". Oz added, ""Under President Trump, many conflicts will be avoided because our enemies will fear the United States and our military.""

Trump Endorsed by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=113823,Donald Trump,"New York, NY (February 29th, 2016) — Today Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach announced that he is endorsing Donald J. Trump for the office of President of the United States.
In addition to his duties as Secretary of State, Kobach has been one of the nation's most prominent advocates of stronger enforcement of immigration laws. He served at the U.S. Department of Justice as Attorney General John Ashcroft's chief adviser on immigration law and border security during 2001-03. In that capacity, he designed and implemented the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS), which was used to monitor the activities of high-risk aliens in the United States after 9-11. Later, he co-authored Arizona's illegal immigration laws of 2007 and 2010. He has helped numerous other states draft state-level laws to reduce illegal immigration. Most notable were Missouri's omnibus immigration act of 2008 and Alabama's omnibus immigration act of 2011. Since 2012, he has represented in court ICE agents who sued the Obama Administration in an effort to stop Obama's executive amnesty of 2012.
""I am pleased to announce my support for Mr. Trump."" said Secretary of State Kris Kobach. ""For me, the most important issue in the Republican presidential contest is immigration and its effect on our national security. On that issue Mr. Trump stands head and shoulders above the other candidates. He has made it clear that ramping up the enforcement of our immigration laws will be his top priority. And he has forcefully rejected the notion of giving amnesty to illegal aliens living in the United States.""
""Now, more than ever, America needs Mr. Trump's aggressive approach to the problem of illegal immigration. Our porous border represents a huge national security threat, and our refugee system has been abused by terrorists in the past and is likely to be abused by ISIS terrorists today. Moreover, there are too many Americans who are out of work because of illegal immigration or who are working in jobs where the wages are depressed because of illegal immigration.""
""Finally, on the subject of building the wall on our southern border, Mr. Trump is correct when he says that the United States has the ability to compel Mexico to pay for it. As I have discussed with Mr. Trump, the PATRIOT Act contains a provision that the United States can and should use as leverage with the Government of Mexico. We have the ability to shut down the flow of remittances to Mexico from illegal aliens working in the United States. Mexico will have to make a choice: either make a single payment of $5-10 billion to the United States to pay for the wall, or lose most of the $23 billion in remittances that Mexico receives every year from its nationals working in the United States.""

Mr. Trump has received tremendous support from the business community where he is highly regarded for his negotiating, deal-making and unprecedented success in a variety of industries.
Mr. Trump stated, ""It is truly an honor to receive the endorsement of two individuals I hold in the highest regard. They are smart, successful and the kind of business leaders our country needs to help negotiate trade deals, create jobs and spur economic development. I am proud to have their support and the support of two business leaders including Carl Icahn.""
Tom Barrack is the Executive Chairman of Colony Capital, Inc. and is considered one of the foremost global real estate investors. Mr. Barrack and Mr. Trump have worked together and opposite each other on past deals. They have had a great relationship and share a mutual admiration for their respective accomplishments.
Barrack said, ""Donald is one of the smartest and most astute businessmen I have had the pleasure of knowing. His mastery of financial, political and economic intellectual complexity combined with his charm and emotional intelligence when partnering with New York labor unions, governmental regulatory bodies, Wall Street lenders, sophisticated institutional global investors, demanding developers, global media and entertainment companies and hard-working employees, is a dynastic art form. I have invested with Donald in a multitude of transactions over three decades and he has always exceeded my expectations on every measurable metric of excellence. Donald is the only candidate in America who comes to the campaign trail already possessing power, wealth and celebrityship … He does not seek the Presidency to gain those accolades -- he has them. He seeks the Presidency to return those great attributes to America from whom he received them. I am happy to give Donald J. Trump my full endorsement to become the next President of the USA.""
Andy Beal of Beal Bank, regarded to as the most successful investor said, ""This country is at a crossroads and needs someone who has the strength of character to pursue ""outside the box"" solutions. I found great opportunity in this country and I want everyone to have access to that same opportunity. I am very concerned that our political system on both sides of the aisle is blocking rather than creating that access to opportunity and is out of touch with the American values that have made America great. Since our inception, our country has always been about creating an environment that fosters opportunity for everyone.""
Beal continued, ""Our government has lost sight of that fundamental principle that makes us all Americans. Instead, government keeps growing at the expense of individual opportunity. Since the financial crisis, our government has squandered many trillion of dollars in increased national debt with absolutely nothing to show for it. I don't agree with everything that anyone says, but I admire people who are willing to say what they are thinking, without regard to the popularity of the statement. Donald Trump is a man who understands the importance of creating opportunity for everyone and who freely speaks his mind. Donald Trump is the man to lead this nation on a new path and to Make America Great Again. I enthusiastically support Donald Trump for President and believe that your support for Donald is essential to put America back on the path to the greatness, that can only be achieved by embracing individual opportunity for everyone.""

(New York, NY) February 29th, 2016 — Today, Donald J. Trump released the surveys completed by two of the three (the third survey is being obtained and is of similar nature) individuals featured in recent ads released by American Future Fund regarding Trump University. The previously unreleased documents show overwhelming support for the school from the individuals featured in the ads.
Donald J. Trump is requesting the immediate retraction of the ads created by American Future Fund, which clearly was unlawfully coordinated with lightweight Senator Marco Rubio on these misleading commercials. The ads feature three individuals who are part of a lawsuit against Trump University, an educational program that has a 98% approval rating from all attendees. These individuals provided written praise of their experience in school surveys (View Kevin Scott & Bob Guillo).
Mr. Trump stated, ""Trump University has a 98% approval rating and an ""A"" rating from the Better Business Bureau. New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman continues to waste taxpayer money trying to smear me, but the fact is that the overwhelming majority of students had a great experience. It's a minor civil case I have not settled out of principle. Lightweight Marco Rubio is grasping at straws and produced terrible ads featuring three people who all provided written statements praising the program. I demand an immediate retraction of this false and libelous ads. It just shows how low a failing campaign will go to help their failing candidate.""
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is a typical politician and just a few weeks before going after Mr. Trump, he was seeking financial support from Mr. Trump's daughter and others close to the GOP frontrunner. When he did not receive contributions he went after Mr. Trump with this frivolous lawsuit based on less than 2% of Trump University attendees. The law firm suing Mr. Trump made a major contribution to Eric Schneiderman before Schneiderman entered the lawsuit. Mr. Trump has won most of the case, which Schneiderman is now appealing.

Trump Announces Senator Sessions as Chairman of National Security Advisory Committee,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=113817,Donald Trump,"Senator Sessions to Provide Strategic Counsel to Mr. Trump on Foreign Policy and Homeland Security
(New York, NY) March 3rd, 2016 — Today Donald J. Trump announced Senator Jeff Sessions, who has advised the GOP frontrunner on issues such as trade and immigration and endorsed Mr. Trump on Sunday in Alabama, will serve as Chairman of Mr. Trump's National Security Advisory Committee. Senator Sessions has been on the Armed Services Committee for almost 20 years and is Chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee.
Mr. Trump stated, ""It is an honor to have Jeff as a member of the team. I have such great respect for him and I look forward to working with him on the issues most important to Americans.""
Senator Sessions added, ""I am grateful for the opportunity to recommend and facilitate discussions among exceptional and experienced American military and diplomatic leaders to share insight and advice with Donald Trump, regardless of their political views. Mr. Trump and the American people know our country needs a clear-eyed foreign policy rooted in the national interest. We need to understand the limits of our ability to intervene successfully in other nations. It is time for a healthy dose of foreign policy realism. In the Middle East, this means forming partnerships based on shared interests, not merely overthrowing regimes in the dangerous attempt to plant democracies. We must also combat the refugee crisis by creating regional safe zones, rather than depopulating the region by migration. The only path to long-term stability and resolution of this humanitarian crisis for the United States and our European allies is to work towards the safe return of migrants to their home countries, as Mr. Trump has noted. This strategy will also protect our own national security.""
Sessions continued, ""A national-interest foreign policy, combined with a military second to none, stands in contrast to interventionist ideas that could enmesh us further in the region's chaos. After over a decade of war and conflict, this country has a host of smart, experienced, and proven leaders. That wisdom must be sought. These meetings will be the beginning of a process that Mr. Trump has called for and which he believes must result in a clear and realistic bipartisan global strategy that will guide our nation for years to come.""
Mr. Trump will continue to announce members of his National Security Advisory Committee and other advisors on key issues over the next few weeks.

Trump Unveils Ad Attacking Marco Rubio to Begin Airing Today in Florida,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=113843,Donald Trump,"(New York, NY) March 7th, 2016 - Today Donald J. Trump unveiled the latest campaign ad attacking Florida's no-show Senator Marco Rubio, to begin airing in Rubio's home state of Florida, leading up to next week's winner-take-all primary. The latest polls show Mr. Trump with a significant lead in Florida, including the recently released Monmouth survey, showing Mr. Trump with 38% support.
Mr. Trump stated, ""Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is a dishonest person. He has cheated with credit cards, and does favors for lobbyists. In my opinion, he is a total crook and I am doing the people of Florida a great favor by further exposing him. In addition to everything else, he is an absentee Senator with one of the worst voting records in the history of the United States Senate, instead preferring to spend his time begging for campaign contributions. He takes his orders from the Republican establishment and Super PACs who are spending millions of dollars to keep their puppet alive and well so he will continue to do what they say. Former Prosecutor and now Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, exposed him on the debate stage for being what he is - a choke artist. We are now going a step further.""
Marco Rubio has violated numerous campaign promises, including on amnesty, betraying every Florida voter. Rubio is well-known in Washington as nothing more than a ""yes-man"" for his corporate benefactors. A vote for Rubio is a vote to put Rubio's donors in charge of the country. A close investigation of Senator Rubio's friends and finances will reveal that he is one of the most corrupt politicians in Washington, D.C.

Our country is declining. If something doesn't change, then my children and future generations of Americans will inherit a mere shadow of what the United States once was. Donald Trump offers the only vision of how to change the path we are on. He has shown a remarkable ability to get things done in the face of seemingly impossible obstructions. No one else in this race has negotiated more successfully than he has in advancing towards a stated goal. He has the wherewithal to go the distance while ignoring the legions of bandit lobbyists in Washington DC and their robber baron bosses from Wall Street. He is unbowed by political correctness and unafraid of the Clinton Machine. He understands the geopolitical peril we face and will rebuild America's reputation and military. He knows the deep debt we owe our veterans. He understands the enormous responsibility of leading America. He understands that he is the President of the whole country. He understands that the decisions he makes will directly affect every American for generations to come. He has learned how to make crucial decisions in a career spanning decades, decisions where if you're wrong then you're out of business, compared to giving eloquent speeches from the safety of the Senate floor. I am proud to endorse his candidacy and to be a volunteer in his campaign, and I look forward to his election as the next President of the United States.

The statement was issued by Local 2544 of the National Border Patrol Council. Local 2544, representing Tucson Agents, is the largest chapter in the Border Patrol Union. The statement, posted to their website, was released by their chapter President, Art Del Cueto:
""On March 19th, 2016 Donald Trump's campaign reached out to Local 2544 about a potential endorsement. I informed Mr. Trump's campaign that NBPC had long standing practice of not endorsing Presidential candidates and that as the President of Local 2544, and I would continue to adhere to that practice.
However, the National Border Patrol Council and Local 2544 are pleased to inform voters that Mr. Trump is the only candidate that has publicly expressed his support of our mission and our agents. He has been an outspoken candidate on the need for a Secure Border and for this we are grateful.
The American public has continually called for a secure border and Donald Trump has promised to make this desire a reality. His campaign has expressed an interest in a Border Patrol's Agent's perspective and a tour of our border, that we will gladly provide. We do not seek to give tours but if asked we will happily provide a tour that gives a realistic idea of what our agents face on a daily basis. Donald Trump is the only candidate who has expressed this interest.
We are confident that the National Border Patrol Council's longstanding message about the unsecured border and much needed support for our Agents will be received well by Mr. Trump. The American public deserves to be secure in their own country and we encourage all voters to consider that candidate that has the political will to make it happen.""
To view the statement on Local 2544's website, please click here. Mr. Trump is deeply grateful for the selfless public service of Border Patrol Agents protecting our nation. Mr. Trump stands strongly behind all Border Patrol Agents and will completely secure the border, enforce all federal immigration laws, safeguard U.S. communities, and finally give our Border Patrol Agents the tools, support and resources they need to fulfill their vital mission.

Trump Announces Campaign Convention Manager Paul J. Manafort,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116591,Donald Trump,"Mr. Trump Prepares for Republican Convention - Seasoned Operative Joins As Convention Manager
(New York, NY) March 29th, 2016 – Today Donald J. Trump announced that Paul J. Manafort will serve as his campaign's Convention Manager. Mr. Manafort is volunteering his considerable insight and expertise because of his belief that Mr. Trump is the right person for these difficult times. He will be responsible for transitioning the Trump campaign's activities as they relate to Mr. Trump's nomination at the convention in Cleveland, Ohio.
Mr. Manafort's experience spans over three decades of working on U.S. presidential campaigns, and includes work on conventions for Presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush, as well as Republican Presidential nominee, Bob Dole. Mr. Trump will use Mr. Manafort's years of experience to support his efforts in all aspects of the convention as he closes in on the Republican nomination for President.
Currently, Mr. Manafort is an attorney and founding partner of DMP International, LLC where he has been active in business and international affairs for the last 20 years. Previously, he was a partner at BMS&K for 15 years and worked on dozens of international political campaigns in an effort to bring democratic expertise to foreign countries. He served as a director of OPIC following his appointment by President Reagan, and was on the Investment Policy Advisory Committee at the Office of the US Trade Representative.
Mr. Trump stated, ""Paul is a great asset and an important addition as we consolidate the tremendous support we have received in the primaries and caucuses, garnering millions more votes than any other candidate. Paul Manafort, and the team I am building, bring the needed skill sets to ensure that the will of the Republican voters, not the Washington political establishment, determines who will be the nominee for the Republican Party. I look forward to winning the nomination, and ultimately the presidency in order to Make America Great Again.""
On his appointment Mr. Manafort said, ""I am honored to serve Mr. Trump's campaign, and look forward to helping secure his nomination as the Republican nominee for President. Mr. Trump has tapped into the growing disillusionment with the Washington political establishment. What he has achieved so far is historic. My role is to work with the professionals that Mr. Trump has assembled to protect the victories that he has won in states across the country. I am confident that he will be the Republican nominee and the next President of the United States.""
In addition, Mr. Trump is announcing that his campaign is opening a Washington, DC based office to coordinate his campaign's work with the Republican National Committee, Congress, and his convention and delegate operations. The office will serve as a conduit for outreach for Mr. Trump's campaign organization nationally.

Trump,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116589,Donald Trump,"(WISCONSIN) March 30th, 2016 - America's Border Patrol Agents broke with their long-standing non-endorsement policy to issue their first-ever endorsement in a presidential primary. The letter from their official union, the National Border Patrol Council, endorsing Donald J. Trump for President, follows below:
""The National Border Patrol Council is the official organization representing our nation's Border Patrol Agents. We represent 16,500 agents who selflessly serve this country in an environment where our own political leaders try to keep us from doing our jobs. The NBPC has had a longstanding practice of not endorsing presidential candidates in the primaries. We will not, however, shy away from voicing our opinions as it pertains to border security and the men and women of the United States Border Patrol. As such, we are breaking with our past practice and giving our first-ever endorsement in a presidential primary. We think it is that important: if we do not secure our borders, American communities will continue to suffer at the hands of gangs, cartels and violent criminals preying on the innocent. The lives and security of the American people are at stake, and the National Border Patrol Council will not sit on the sidelines.
As an organization we expect our elected officials to aggressively pursue the interests of the country. America has already tried a young, articulate freshman senator who never created a job as an attorney and under whose watch criminal cartels have been given the freest border reign ever known.
Unlike his opponents, Donald Trump is not a career politician, he is an outsider who has created thousands of jobs, pledged to bring about aggressive pro-American change, and who is completely independent of special interests. We don't need a person who has the perfect Washington-approved tone, and certainly NOT another establishment politician in the White House. Indeed, the fact that people are more upset about Mr. Trump's tone than about the destruction wrought by open borders tells us everything we need to know about the corruption in Washington.
We need a person in the White House who doesn't fear the media, who doesn't embrace political correctness, who doesn't need the money, who is familiar with success, who won't bow to foreign dictators, who is pro-military and values law enforcement, and who is angry for America and NOT subservient to the interests of other nations. Donald Trump is such a man.
Mr. Trump is as bold and outspoken as other world leaders who put their country's interests ahead of all else. Americans deserve to benefit for once instead of always paying and apologizing. Our current political establishment has bled this country dry, sees their power evaporating, and isn't listening to voters who do all the heavy lifting. Trump is opposed by the established powers specifically because they know he is the only candidate who actually threatens the established powers that have betrayed this country.
You can judge a man by his opponents: all the people responsible for the problems plaguing America today are opposing Mr. Trump. It is those without political power – the workers, the law enforcement officers, the everyday families and community members – who are supporting Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump will take on special interests and embrace the ideas of rank-and-file Border Patrol agents rather than listening to the management yes-men who say whatever they are programmed to say. This is a refreshing change that we have not seen before – and may never see again.
Mr. Trump is correct when he says immigration wouldn't be at the forefront of this presidential campaign if months ago he hadn't made some bold and necessary statements. And when the withering media storm ensued he did not back down one iota. That tells you the measure of a man. When the so-called experts said he was too brash and outspoken, and that he would fade away, they were proven wrong. We are confident they will be proven wrong again in November when he becomes President of the United States.
There is no greater physical or economic threat to Americans today than our open border. And there is no greater political threat than the control of Washington by special interests. In view of these threats, the National Border Patrol Council endorses Donald J. Trump for President – and asks the American people to support Mr. Trump in his mission to finally secure the border of the United States of America, before it is too late.""
